"Apalutamide is a potent androgen receptor (AR) antagonist that selectively binds to the ligand-binding domain of AR and blocks AR nuclear translocation or binding to androgen response elements [A31846]. It has been used in trials studying the treatment of Prostate Cancer, Hepatic Impairment, Prostatic Neoplasms, Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer, and Prostatic Neoplasms, Castration-Resistant, among others. Exerting an antitumor action, apalutamide blocking the effect of androgens that promote tumor growth. It targets the AR ligand-binding domain and prevents AR nuclear translocation, DNA binding, and transcription of AR gene targets in prostate tumors [A31846]. In mice bearing human CRPC xenograft models, apalutamide treatment produced tumor regressions in a dose-dependent manner that was more effective than that of [DB01128] or [DB08899]. Unlike bicalutamide, apalutamide antagonized AR-mediated signaling in AR overexpressing human CRPC cell lines [A31846].

Androgen-deprivation therapy, or hormone therapy, can be used as part of maintenance therapy for patients with non-metastatic prostate cancer. Although most patients achieve therapeutic responses at the initial hormone therapy, many patients progress to non-metastatic castration-resistant (resistance to hormone therapy) prostate cancer which is the second-most common cause of cancer-related deaths in American males [A31852]. Castration-resistant prostate cancer is often incurable, which poses significant clinical challenges for patients. Approximately 10 to 20 % of prostate cancer cases are castration-resistant, and up to 16% of these patients show no evidence of cancer metastasis at the time of castration-resistant diagnosis [L1295]. Higher prostate-specific antigen (PSA) and shorter PSA doubling time (PSA DT) are associated with a higher risk for metastases and death [A31846]. In a phase-2 multicenter open-label study, 89% of patients with non-metastatic, castration-resistant prostate cancer had ≥50% PSA decline at week 12 of apalutamide treatment [A31846]. In a randomized trial, the median metastasis-free survival for patients taking apalutamide was 40.5 months compared to 16.2 months for patients taking a placebo [L1295]. Apalutamide displayed good tolerability and safety profile in clinical studies. 

Apalutamide was approved in February 2018 by the FDA as Erleada for the treatment of patients with non-metastatic prostate cancer that is resistant to treatment with hormone therapy (castration-resistant). It is available as oral tablets.

"Produced in CHO cell cultures, trastuzumab is a recombinant IgG1 kappa, humanized monoclonal antibody [A40276] that selectively binds with high affinity in a cell-based assay (Kd = 5 nM) to the extracellular domain of the human epidermal growth factor receptor protein (HER2).[L14015] It is used as a treatment of human epidermal growth factor receptor (HER)-2+ metastatic breast cancer, where there is a proven amplification of the HER-2 oncogene or over-expression of the HER-2 protein in tumours. It is suggested that the overexpression or gene amplification of HER2 has been found in about 20–30% of breast cancers and elevated activation of HER2 triggers multiple downstream pathways leading to abnormal proliferation of cancer cells [A121]. Trastuzumab binds to HER2 and suppresses cancer cell growth, proliferation, and survival directly and indirectly [A121].

However, araC is only slowly converted to araCTP in the liver or in primary liver tumors due to low levels of an enzyme in the liver that is required for the conversion of araC to araCMP, the first step in the activation pathway of the drug. Higher doses of araC cannot be used to overcome this limitation due to bone marrow toxicity resulting from rapid activation in that tissue. MB07133 uses our HepDirect technology to target a prodrug form of araCMP specifically to the liver. Once in the liver cell, the prodrug is rapidly cleaved, producing araCMP, bypassing the rate-limiting enzyme. Once generated in the target tissue, araCMP is rapidly converted to araCTP, the cancer-killing active form. ",MBO7133,,,"","","",false

"Dostarlimab is an IgG<sub>4</sub> humanized monoclonal antibody targeted against the human programmed death receptor-1 (PD-1).[L33320] PD-1 receptors are found on T-cells and, when activated, serve to inhibit immune responses - some cancers leverage this system by overexpressing PD-1 ligands, thereby effectively inhibiting the anti-tumor immune response that would typically attempt to destroy the cancerous cells.[A234379] Agents acting on the PD-1 pathway, such as [nivolumab] and [pembrolizumab], facilitate endogenous immune-mediated anti-tumor activity and may therefore be used to treat a wide variety of cancers, including those of the skin, lung, kidneys, and liver. 

In April 2021, dostarlimab was granted an accelerated approval by the FDA - as GlaxoSmithKline's dostarlimab-gxly (Jemperli) - for the treatment of adult patients with recurrent or advanced mismatch repair deficient (dMMR) endometrial cancer experiencing disease progression despite treatment with platinum-containing chemotherapy regimens.[L33340] As this accelerated approval was granted only for the treatment of dMMR endometrial cancers, it was approved alongside a companion diagnostic device - the VENTANA MMR RxDx Panel - for use in selecting appropriate patients for treatment.[L33340]

Dostarlimab is currently under investigation for the treatment of rectal cancers with mismatch repair deficiency. A prospective phase II study in patients with mismatch repair-deficient locally advanced rectal cancer resulted in all twelve patients exhibiting a complete clinical response.[A248905]",Dostarlimab,P0GVQ9A4S5,,Programmed cell death protein 1,Q15116,PDCD1,true

"Prostate cancer is the most common non-cutaneous malignancy affecting men in North America[A235344] - despite this, an ongoing challenge in prostate cancer therapy is the difficulty in imaging the extent and location of tumor metastases and recurrences.[L34319] The images generated by positron emission tomography (PET) are less detailed than those obtained via MRI or CT, but are more sensitive and can reveal cancerous tissue in any area of the body provided the tissue is expressing the appropriate target protein. Prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) is a transmembrane glycoprotein expressed in many tissues that plays a role in folate uptake and neurotransmitter release - it is expressed in the prostate at levels roughly 1000-fold greater than elsewhere in the body, and even higher in prostate cancer tissue.[A235169] As such, it has become a desirable target for PET imaging of prostate cancer tissues.

Piflufolastat F18, also called [F-18]-DCFPyL, is a urea-based radiopharmaceutical that binds to PSMA and allows for the visualization of cancerous prostate tissue.

"Tirapazamine, also known as SR-4233, is an experimental anticancer drug that is activated in hypoxic conditions. This activation is very useful as this hypoxic state is found in human solid tumors in a common phenomenon known as tumor hypoxia. Hence, tirapazamine is solely activated in those hypoxic areas of solid tumors. It is important to take into consideration that normally, the cells in these hypoxic regions are resistant to radiotherapy and most anticancer drugs. For all these reasons, the combination of tirapazamine with other anticancer treatments is highly recommended.

Trk, a receptor tyrosine kinase activated by neurotrophins, is mutated in a variety of cancer cell types and plays an important role in tumor cell growth and survival.

"Lenvatinib is a receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) inhibitor that inhibits the kinase activities of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) receptors VEGFR1 (FLT1), VEGFR2 (KDR), and VEGFR3 (FLT4). Lenvatinib also inhibits other RTKs that have been implicated in pathogenic angiogenesis, tumor growth, and cancer progression in addition to their normal cellular functions, including fibroblast growth factor (FGF) receptors FGFR1, 2, 3, and 4; the platelet derived growth factor receptor alpha (PDGFRα), KIT, and RET. These receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) located in the cell membrane play a central role in the activation of signal transduction pathways involved in the normal regulation of cellular processes, such as cell proliferation, migration, apoptosis and differentiation, and in pathogenic angiogenesis, lymphogenesis, tumour growth and cancer progression. In particular, VEGF has been identified as a crucial regulator of both physiologic and pathologic angiogenesis and increased expression of VEGF is associated with a poor prognosis in many types of cancers.

Lenvatinib is indicated for the treatment of patients with locally recurrent or metastatic, progressive, radioactive iodine (RAI)-refractory differentiated thyroid cancer. Most patients with thyroid cancer have a very good prognosis with treatment (98% 5 year survival rate) involving surgery and hormone therapy. However, for patients with RAI-refractory thyroid cancer, treatment options are limited and the prognosis is poor, leading to a push for the development of more targeted therapies such as lenvatinib.",Lenvatinib,EE083865G2,COC1=C(C=C2C(OC3=CC=C(NC(=O)NC4CC4)C(Cl)=C3)=CC=NC2=C1)C(N)=O,Vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 1; Vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2; Vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 3; Fibroblast growth factor receptor 1; Fibroblast growth factor receptor 2; Fibroblast growth factor receptor 3; Fibroblast growth factor receptor 4; Platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha; Proto-oncogene tyrosine-protein kinase receptor Ret; Mast/stem cell growth factor receptor Kit; P-glycoprotein 1; ATP-binding cassette sub-family G member 2; Cytochrome P450 3A4; Aldehyde oxidase; Cytochrome P450 2C8; Cytochrome P450 2C9; Cytochrome P450 1A2; Cytochrome P450 2B6; Cytochrome P450 2C19; Solute carrier family 22 member 6; Solute carrier family 22 member 8; Solute carrier family 22 member 2; Solute carrier organic anion transporter family member 1B1; Bile salt export pump; Cytochrome P450 2D6; Solute carrier organic anion transporter family member 1B3,P17948; P35968; P35916; P11362; P21802; P22607; P22455; P16234; P07949; P10721; P08183; Q9UNQ0; P08684; Q06278; P10632; P11712; P05177; P20813; P33261; Q4U2R8; Q8TCC7; O15244; Q9Y6L6; O95342; P10635; Q9NPD5,FLT1; KDR; FLT4; FGFR1; FGFR2; FGFR3; FGFR4; PDGFRA; RET; KIT; ABCB1; ABCG2; CYP3A4; AOX1; CYP2C8; CYP2C9; CYP1A2; CYP2B6; CYP2C19; SLC22A6; SLC22A8; SLC22A2; SLCO1B1; ABCB11; CYP2D6; SLCO1B3,true

"Alpelisib is a phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitor with potent antitumor activity. It works by selectively inhibiting class I PI3K p110α [A179203], which is the catalytic subunit of PI3K, a lipid kinase that plays a role in various biological processes, including proliferation, survival, differentiation, and metabolism. Alpelisib was designed to target this enzyme that appears to be mutated at a rate of nearly 30% in human cancers, leading to hyperactivation.[A179209] 

There are several isoform-specific PI3K inhibitors that are under clinical development or currently approved, such as [idelalisib] used for chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL).[A179209] Approved by the FDA in May 2019, alpelisib is the first approved PI3K inhibitor indicated for the treatment of hormone receptor (HR)-positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-negative, PIK3CA-mutated, advanced or metastatic breast cancer in combination with [fulvestrant] for postmenopausal women and male patients. To initiate alpelisib therapy, it is required that the presence of a PIK3CA mutation in the tissue and/or liquid biopsy sample collection should be confirmed via FDA-approved diagnostic tests. Alpelisib is marketed under the trade name Piqray and is available as oral tablets. Studies evaluating the therapeutic effectiveness of alpelisib in other cancers, such as ovarian cancer [A179200] and colorectal cancer [A179203], are under ongoing investigations.

Alpelisib was granted FDA approval on 24 May 2019.[L6652] In April 2022, the FDA granted the use of alpelisib in the treatment of PIK3CA-Related Overgrowth Spectrum (PROS) in adults and children who require systemic therapy.[L41384]",Alpelisib,08W5N2C97Q,CC1=C(SC(NC(=O)N2CCC[C@H]2C(N)=O)=N1)C1=CC(=NC=C1)C(C)(C)C(F)(F)F,"Phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase catalytic subunit alpha isoform; Cytochrome P450 3A4; Cytochrome P450 2C9; Cytochrome P450 2C8; Cytochrome P450 2C19; ATP-binding cassette sub-family G member 2; P-glycoprotein 1",P42336; P08684; P11712; P10632; P33261; Q9UNQ0; P08183,PIK3CA; CYP3A4; CYP2C9; CYP2C8; CYP2C19; ABCG2; ABCB1,true

"Raloxifene is a second generation selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM) that mediates anti-estrogenic effects on breast and uterine tissues, and estrogenic effects on bone, lipid metabolism, and blood coagulation.[A4979,T28] Exhibiting tissue-specific effects distinct from [estradiol], raloxifene is the first of the benzothiophene group of antiestrogens to be labelled a SERM.[A4977] Available in many countries worldwide, raloxifene was initially approved by the FDA in December, 1997 under the market name Evista® for the management and prevention of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women and reduction in risk for invasive breast cancer in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis or those who are at high risk for invasive breast cancer. However, it has a negligible effect on altering the development and progression of breast cancer itself.[label] The most common causes of osteoporosis include postmenopausal deficiency of estrogen and age-related deterioration in bone homeostasis. Due to the risk of bone fractures that may lead to morbidities and reduced quality of life, the management of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women with the use of therapeutic agents in addition to concurrent therapies is critical. Due to the decline in estrogen levels in postmenopausal osteoporosis, hormone replacement therapy (HRT), such as estradiol, has been used to ameliorate the condition. However, due to the off-target actions by HRT, newer non-hormonal agents such as raloxifene and [tamoxifen] have been developed to reduce adverse events through selective pharmacological actions on tissue-specific therapeutic targets.[T28]

The main effects of raloxifene are to preserve the bone mineral density and decrease the risk of breast cancer in postmenopausal women. Compared to estrogen and tamoxifen, raloxifene was not associated with an increased risk of uterine cancer and it does not cause endometrial proliferation.[A716] Although rare, there was an increased risk of venous thromboembolism during clinical trials of postmenopausal women receiving raloxifene. In addition, a clinical study consisting of postmenopausal women with documented coronary heart disease or at increased risk for coronary events showed an increased risk for fatal stroke with raloxifene therapy compared to placebo.[label] It is strongly advised that the risk-benefit ratio is considered before starting raloxifene therapy in women at risk of thromboembolic disease or strokes, such as the prior history of stroke, transient ischemic attack, atrial fibrillation, hypertension, or cigarette smoking.[label]",Raloxifene,YX9162EO3I,OC1=CC=C(C=C1)C1=C(C(=O)C2=CC=C(OCCN3CCCCC3)C=C2)C2=C(S1)C=C(O)C=C2,Estrogen receptor alpha; Estrogen receptor beta; Aldehyde oxidase; Cytochrome P450 2C8; Cytochrome P450 2B6; Cytochrome P450 19A1; Cytochrome P450 3A4; Serpin B9; Trefoil factor 1; UDP-glucuronosyltransferase 1-1; Serum albumin; Alpha-1-acid glycoprotein 1; Solute carrier organic anion transporter family member 1B1; Solute carrier organic anion transporter family member 1B3; P-glycoprotein 1; ATP-binding cassette sub-family G member 2; Canalicular multispecific organic anion transporter 1; Canalicular multispecific organic anion transporter 2; Multidrug resistance-associated protein 4; UDP-glucuronosyltransferase 1-10; UDP-glucuronosyltransferase 1-8,P03372; Q92731; Q06278; P10632; P20813; P11511; P08684; P50453; P04155; P22309; P02768; P02763; Q9Y6L6; Q9NPD5; P08183; Q9UNQ0; Q92887; O15438; O15439; Q9HAW8; Q9HAW9,ESR1; ESR2; AOX1; CYP2C8; CYP2B6; CYP19A1; CYP3A4; SERPINB9; TFF1; UGT1A1; ALB; ORM1; SLCO1B1; SLCO1B3; ABCB1; ABCG2; ABCC2; ABCC3; ABCC4; UGT1A10; UGT1A8,true

At the end of 2006, the Company also completed patient enrollment in our single-agent Phase Ib/II and Phase II trials of ADH-1.


Cadherins are cell adhesion and cell signaling molecules crucial to the development of tissues, organs and organisms. Agents that target and inhibit cadherin function have the potential to attack the progression of cancer at two distinct points:

    * Direct targeting of cadherins expressed on cancer cells may disturb cadherin-mediated signaling, leading to apoptosis (death) of cancer cells.
    * Cadherin inhibitors may exploit the inherent structural weaknesses of the tumor vasculature, causing angiolysis (disruption of blood vessels) and tumor damage.

As many tumors become more aggressive, invasive, and malignant, researchers have found that N-cadherin is expressed in greater amounts, making it an important target for developing anti-cancer treatments.

Poorly differentiated, highly invasive carcinomas are characterized by over-expression of N-cadherin (as opposed to E-cadherin). This change in primary cadherin expression causes the epithelial cells to lose their tightly adherent, polarized and well-defined shape and become loosely adherent, flattened and migratory. Such cadherin switching promotes properties such as dedifferentiation, local invasion and metastasis, leading to poor prognosis.

ADH-1 may have utility in a wide variety of cancers as N-cadherin is overexpressed in a variety of tumors. As tumors progress to become higher grade, invasive and more metastatic, the frequency of N-cadherin expression generally rises.

"Ceritinib is used for the treatment of adults with anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK)-positive metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) following failure (secondary to resistance or intolerance) of prior crizotinib therapy. About 4% of patients with NSCLC have a chromosomal rearrangement that generates a fusion gene between EML4 (echinoderm microtubule-associated protein-like 4) and ALK (anaplastic lymphoma kinase), which results in constitutive kinase activity that contributes to carcinogenesis and seems to drive the malignant phenotype. Ceritinib exerts its therapeutic effect by inhibiting autophosphorylation of ALK, ALK-mediated phosphorylation of the downstream signaling protein STAT3, and proliferation of ALK-dependent cancer cells. Following treatment with crizotinib (a first-generation ALK inhibitor), most tumours develop drug resistance due to mutations in key ""gatekeeper"" residues of the enzyme.

"Levoleucovorin is the enantiomerically active form of Folinic Acid (also known as 5-formyl tetrahydrofolic acid or leucovorin). Commercially available leucovorin is composed of a 1:1 racemic mixture of the dextrorotary and levorotary isomers, while levoleucovorin contains only the pharmacologically active levo-isomer. In vitro, the levo-isomer has been shown to be rapidly converted to the biologically available methyl-tetrahydrofolate form while the dextro form is slowly excreted by the kidneys. Despite this difference in activity, the two commercially available forms have been shown to be pharmacokinetically identical and may be used interchangeably with limited differences in efficacy or side effects (Kovoor et al, 2009). 

As folate analogs, levoleucovorin and leucovorin are both used to counteract the toxic effects of folic acid antagonists, such as methotrexate, which act by inhibiting the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR). They are indicated for use as rescue therapy following use of high-dose methotrexate in the treatment of osteosarcoma or for diminishing the toxicity associated with inadvertent overdosage of folic acid antagonists. Levoleucovorin, as the product Fusilev (FDA), has an additional indication for use in combination chemotherapy with 5-fluorouracil in the palliative treatment of patients with advanced metastatic colorectal cancer. 

Folic acid is an essential B vitamin required by the body for the synthesis of purines, pyrimidines, and methionine before incorporation into DNA or protein. However, in order to function in this role, it must first be reduced by the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) into the cofactors dihydrofolate (DHF) and tetrahydrofolate (THF). This important pathway, which is required for de novo synthesis of nucleic acids and amino acids, is disrupted when high-dose methotrexate is used for cancer therapy. As methotrexate functions as a DHFR inhibitor to prevent DNA synthesis in rapidly dividing cells, it also prevents the formation of DHF and THF. This results in a deficiency of coenzymes and a resultant buildup of toxic substances that are responsible for numerous adverse side effects of methotrexate therapy. As levoleucovorin and leucovorin are analogs of tetrahydrofolate (THF), they are able to bypass DHFR reduction and act as a cellular replacement for the co-factor THF, thereby preventing these toxic side effects.",Levoleucovorin,990S25980Y,NC1=NC(=O)C2=C(NC[C@H](CNC3=CC=C(C=C3)C(=O)N[C@@H](CCC(O)=O)C(O)=O)N2C=O)N1,Serine hydroxymethyltransferase,P0A827,glyA,true

"Folinic Acid (also known as 5-formyl tetrahydrofolic acid or leucovorin) is the 5-formyl derivative of tetrahydrofolic acid, a necessary co-factor in the body. Commercially available leucovorin is composed of a 1:1 racemic mixture of the dextrorotary and levorotary isomers, while levoleucovorin contains only the pharmacologically active levo-isomer. In vitro, the levo-isomer has been shown to be rapidly converted to the biologically available methyl-tetrahydrofolate form while the dextro form is slowly excreted by the kidneys. Despite this difference in activity, the two commercially available forms have been shown to be pharmacokinetically identical and may be used interchangeably with limited differences in efficacy or side effects (Kovoor et al, 2009). 

As folate analogs, leucovorin and levoleucovorin are both used to counteract the toxic effects of folic acid antagonists, such as methotrexate, which act by inhibiting the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR). They are indicated for use as rescue therapy following use of high-dose methotrexate in the treatment of osteosarcoma or for diminishing the toxicity associated with inadvertent overdosage of folic acid antagonists. Injectable forms are also indicated for use in the treatment of megaloblastic anemias due to folic acid deficiency when oral therapy is not feasible and for use in combination with 5-fluorouracil to prolong survival in the palliative treatment of patients with advanced colorectal cancer. 

Folic acid is an essential B vitamin required by the body for the synthesis of purines, pyrimidines, and methionine before incorporation into DNA or protein. However, in order to function in this role, it must first be reduced by the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) into the cofactors dihydrofolate (DHF) and tetrahydrofolate (THF). This important pathway, which is required for de novo synthesis of nucleic acids and amino acids, is disrupted when high-dose methotrexate is used for cancer therapy. As methotrexate functions as a DHFR inhibitor to prevent DNA synthesis in rapidly dividing cells, it also prevents the formation of DHF and THF. This results in a deficiency of coenzymes and a resultant buildup of toxic substances that are responsible for numerous adverse side effects associated with methotrexate therapy. As levoleucovorin and leucovorin are analogs of tetrahydrofolate (THF), they are able to bypass DHFR reduction and act as a cellular replacement for the co-factor THF, thereby preventing these toxic side effects.",Leucovorin,Q573I9DVLP,[H]C(=O)N1C(CNC2=CC=C(C=C2)C(=O)N[C@@H](CCC(O)=O)C(O)=O)CNC2=C1C(=O)NC(N)=N2,Solute carrier family 22 member 8,Q8TCC7,SLC22A8,true

"Folic acid, also known as folate or Vitamin B9, is a member of the B vitamin family and an essential cofactor for enzymes involved in DNA and RNA synthesis. More specifically, folic acid is required by the body for the synthesis of purines, pyrimidines, and methionine before incorporation into DNA or protein. Folic acid is particularly important during phases of rapid cell division, such as infancy, pregnancy, and erythropoiesis, and plays a protective factor in the development of cancer. As humans are unable to synthesize folic acid endogenously, diet and supplementation is necessary to prevent deficiencies. For example, folic acid is present in green vegetables, beans, avocado, and some fruits.[L5744]

In order to function within the body, folic acid must first be reduced by the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) into the cofactors dihydrofolate (DHF) and tetrahydrofolate (THF). This important pathway, which is required for de novo synthesis of nucleic acids and amino acids, is disrupted by anti-metabolite therapies such as [DB00563] as they function as DHFR inhibitors to prevent DNA synthesis in rapidly dividing cells, and therefore prevent the formation of DHF and THF. When used in high doses such as for cancer therapy, or in low doses such as for Rheumatoid Arthritis or psoriasis, [DB00563] impedes the body's ability to create folic acid. This results in a deficiency of coenzymes and a resultant buildup of toxic substances that are responsible for numerous adverse side effects. As a result, supplementation with 1-5mg of folic acid is recommended to prevent deficiency and a number of side effects associated with MTX therapy including mouth ulcers and gastrointestinal irritation. [DB00650] (also known as folinic acid) supplementation is typically used for high-dose MTX regimens for the treatment of cancer. Levoleucovorin and leucovorin are analogs of tetrahydrofolate (THF) and are able to bypass DHFR reduction to act as a cellular replacement for the co-factor THF.

There are also several antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) that are associated with reduced serum and red blood cell folate, including [DB00564] (CBZ), [DB00252] (PHT), or barbiturates.[A37004] Folic acid is therefore often provided as supplementation to individuals using these medications, particularly to women of child-bearing age. 

Inadequate folate levels can result in a number of health concerns including cardiovascular disease, megaloblastic anemias, cognitive deficiencies, and neural tube defects (NTDs). Folic acid is typically supplemented during pregnancy to prevent the development of NTDs and in individuals with alcoholism to prevent the development of neurological disorders, for example.",Folic acid,935E97BOY8,NC1=NC(=O)C2=NC(CNC3=CC=C(C=C3)C(=O)N[C@@H](CCC(O)=O)C(O)=O)=CN=C2N1,Folate receptor gamma; Folate receptor beta; Methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase; Multidrug resistance-associated protein 4; Solute carrier family 22 member 6; Canalicular multispecific organic anion transporter 2; ATP-binding cassette sub-family C member 11; ATP-binding cassette sub-family G member 2; Proton-coupled folate transporter; Mitochondrial folate transporter/carrier; Gamma-glutamyl hydrolase; Folate receptor alpha; Dihydrofolate reductase,P41439; P14207; P42898; O15439; Q4U2R8; O15438; Q96J66; Q9UNQ0; Q96NT5; Q9H2D1; Q92820; P15328; P00374,FOLR3; FOLR2; MTHFR; ABCC4; SLC22A6; ABCC3; ABCC11; ABCG2; SLC46A1; SLC25A32; GGH; FOLR1; DHFR,true

"Technetium Tc-99m tilmanocept is a radiopharmaceutical diagnostic imaging agent approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the imaging of lymph nodes with or without scintigraphic imaging. It is a macromolecule consisting of multiple units of diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (DTPA) and mannose, each covalently attached to a 10 kDa dextran backbone [FDA Label]. DTPA serves as a chelating agent for technetium Tc 99m to bind [FDA Label]. Technetium Tc-99m tilmanocept is used in lymphatic mapping and lymph node localization in breast cancer, melanoma, clinically node-negative squamous cell carcinoma of the oral cavity, and other solid tumors [A32169, A32170]. Detecting sentinel lymph node (SLN) is clinically useful in the prognosis and management of the disease, as it is considered as the first lymph node that receives afferent lymphatic drainage from a primary tumor, and may be used to predict tumour staging and metastasis [A32170]. However, as nodal micrometastasis in breast cancer may not be associated with significant changes in survival, it is also important to identify clinically node-negative patients [A32170]. 

Technetium Tc-99m tilmanocept is a novel CD206 receptor-targeted molecule that selectively binds to mannose receptors expressed on the surface of reticuloendothelial cells in lymph nodes [A32168]. Due to its relatively small molecular weight and small molecular diameter of 7 nm [A32168], technetium Tc-99m tilmanocept displays more rapid injection site clearance, high sentinel node extraction, and low distal node accumulation compared to other conventional radiocolloids [A32170]. It achieves high overall accuracy in detecting SLN [A32169]. Once reconstituted and labelled, technetium Tc99m tilmanocept is intended to be injected in close proximity to the tumor being diagnosed and employed in preoperative gamma detection imaging in combination with various other techniques, including scintigraphy, SPECT, and SPECT/CT [L1157]. It may be administered via subcutaneous, intradermal, subareolar, or peritumoral injection, depending on the tutor location and planned injection technique [FDA Label]. It is marketed under the trade name Lymphoseek. Potential application of technetium Tc-99m tilmanocept to other cancers are being investigated [A32170].",Technetium Tc-99m tilmanocept,8IHI69PQTC,,Macrophage mannose receptor 1,P22897,MRC1,true

"Isoflavone is a soy phytoestrogen and a biologically active component of several agriculturally important legumes such as soy, peanut, green peas, chick peas and alfalfa [A33103]. Soybean is an exceptionally rich source of dietary isoflavones, where the average isoflavone content is 1-2 mg/gram [A33103]. The main soy isoflavones are mostly present in glycosylated forms and include [DB01645], [DB13182], and glycitein, which accounts for approximately 50%, 40%, and 10%, respectively, of the total soybean isoflavone content [A33098]. The clinical benefits of soy proteins have been studied and demonstrated for many years, with some evidence of soy products associated with a reduced incidences of coronary heart disease, atherosclerosis, type II diabetes mellitus, and breast and prostate cancer [A33099]. While existing data are consistent or inadequate in supporting most of the suggested health benefits of consuming soy proteins and isoflavones [A33099], the trials investigating isoflavone as a potential treatment for atrophy, menopause, and postmenopausal symptoms are ongoing.

"Droloxifene, a derivative of the triphenylethylene drug tamoxifen, is a novel selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM). Droloxifene also exhibits more rapid pharmacokinetics, reaching peak concentrations and being eliminated much more rapidly than tamoxifen. Its higher affinity to the estrogen receptor, higher anti-estrogenic to estrogenic ratio, more effective inhibition of cell growth and division in estrogen receptor-positive cell lines, and lower toxicity give it theoretical advantages over tamoxifen in the treatment of human breast cancer. Short-term toxicity was generally mild, and similar to that seen with other antiestrogens. Droloxifene appears active and tolerable. It may have a particular role in situations in which rapid pharmacokinetics, or an increased antiestrogenic to estrogenic ratio, are required. Droloxifene may also be a potentially useful agent for the treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis because it can prevent estrogen deficiency-induced bone loss without causing uterine hypertrophy. Droloxifene may have an effect on bone and breast tissue because it induces apoptosis. Droloxifene has an anti-implantation effect in rats, and the effect appears to be not completely due to its anti-estrogenic activity.[L34184]",Droloxifene,0M67U6Z98F,CC\C(=C(\C1=CC=C(OCCN(C)C)C=C1)C1=CC=CC(O)=C1)C1=CC=CC=C1,"","","",false
"Leuprolide is a synthetic 9-residue peptide analogue of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH). Unlike the endogenous decapeptide GnRH, leuprolide contains a single D-amino acid (D-leucyl) residue, which helps to increase its circulating half-life from three to four minutes to approximately three hours.[A203222] As a GnRH mimic, leuprolide is capable of binding to the GnRH receptor (GnRHR) and inducing downstream modulation of both gonadotropin hormone and sex steroid levels. Prolonged activation of GnRHR results in significant downregulation of sex steroid levels, which is primarily responsible for the clinical efficacy of leuprolide in diverse conditions, including advanced prostate cancer, endometriosis, and central precocious puberty.[A203126, A203132]

"Formestane was the first selective, type I, steroidal aromatase inhibitor used in the treatment of estrogen-receptor positive breast cancer in post-menopausal women. Formestane suppresses estrogen production from anabolic steroids or prohormones. Formestane is also a prohormone of 4-hydroxytestosterone, an active steroid with weak androgenic activity and mild aromatase inhibitor activity. It is listed as a prohibited substance by the World Anti-Doping Agency for use in athletes.  

Formestane has poor oral bioavailability, and thus must be administered fortnightly (bi-weekly) by intramuscular injection. Some clinical data has suggested that the clinically recommended dose of 250mg was too low. With the discovery of newer, non-steroidal and steroidal, aromatase inhibitors which were orally active and less expensive than formestane, formestane lost popularity.

Promestriene’s potential for treating vaginal atrophy symptoms associated with aromatase inhibitor treatment would be precluded if its minimal absorption leads to estrogen-like effects on cell proliferation and estrogen-responsive gene expression. The concern with absorbed vaginal estrogens or estrogen analogs is that they activate occult sites of residual breast cancer or negate the tumor suppressive effects of aromatase inhibitor adjuvant therapy.

Chimeric antigen receptors (CARs) are artificial receptors consisting of an antibody-derived antigen binding domain and transmembrane and signaling domains from T-cell receptor signalling moieties. First used with autologous human T cells (CAR-T) as cancer immunotherapies, these receptors are now being engineered onto natural killer (NK) cells due to lower potential for graft-versus-host disease and cytokine release syndrome. The IL-15 superagonist increases the activity of NK cells and improves their target cytotoxicity. The GM-CSF acts as a neutralizer for the CAR-T cell-mediated cytokine release and neurotoxicity.

"2-deoxyglucose is predominantly used as a diagnostic agent in its radiolabelled form (fluorine-18 is used as the radiolabel). By using positron emission tomography (PET), radiolabelled 2-deoxyglucose can determine glucose metabolism, which is altered in diseases such as cardiovascular disease, tumors, and Alzheimer's disease. Therapeutically, 2-deoxyglucose is an investigational drug that is being studied as an anticancer and antiviral agent. Concerning the former, 2- deoxyglucose was used as an adjunct to chemotherapy and radiotherapy in the treatment of solid tumors (lung, breast, pancreas, head, neck, and gastric tumors). The exact mechanisms of action of 2-deoxyglucose is still being investigated, but it is known that in hypoxic cancer cells, 2-deoxyglucose is a glycolysis inhibitor that prevents ATP production and, ultimately, cell survival. With respect to antiviral therapy, 2-deoxyglucose was shown to be effective against herpes simplex virus by affecting the virus' ability to penetrate cells. As an experimental drug, 2-deoxyglucose was demonstrated to work as an anticonvulsant in temporal lobe epilepsy. In this condition, 2-deoxyglucose represses the expression of certain proteins that are at high levels after a seizure.

"Iodide I-131 (as Sodium iodide I-131) is a radioisotopic drug used for the treatment and palliation of thyroid malignancy.  Iodine-131 is notable for causing mutation and death in cells that it penetrates, which is due to its mode of beta decay. As a result of beta decay, approximately 10% of its energy and radiation dose is via gamma radiation, while the other 90% (beta radiation) causes tissue damage without contributing to any ability to see or image the isotope. Low levels of beta radiation are also known for causing cancer as this dose is highly mutagenic. For this reason, less toxic iodine isotopes such as I-123 are more frequently used in nuclear imaging, while I-131 is reserved for its tissue destroying effects. Because the thyroid gland naturally takes up iodine from the body, therapeutic methods using radioisotopes can take advantage of this mechanism for localization of drug to the site of malignancy. 

Therapeutic solutions of Sodium Iodide-131 are indicated for the treatment of hyperthyroidism and thyroid carcinomas that take up iodine.  Palliative effects may be observed in patients with advanced thyroid malignancy if the metastatic lesions take up iodine.  It is also indicated for use in performance of the radioactive iodide (RAI) uptake test to evaluate thyroid function.",Iodide I-131,4GC1FOQ22U,[131I-],"","","",true
"Cantharidin is a naturally occurring odorless, colorless fatty substance of the terpenoid class that is produced as an oral fluid in the alimentary canal of the male blister beetle [A32891, A32892]. For its natural purpose, the male blister beetle secretes and presents the cantharidin to a female beetle as a copulatory gift during mating. Post-copulation, the female beetle places the cantharidin over her eggs as protection against any potential predators.

Available synthetically since the 1950s, topical applications of cantharidin have been used predominantly as a treatment for cutaneous warts since that time [A32891, A32892]. In 1962 however, marketers of cantharidin failed to produce sufficient efficacy data, resulting in the FDA revision of approval of cantharidin [A32892].

Today, topical cantharidin products do not necessarily demonstrate any particular better effectiveness at treating topical skin conditions like warts than other commonly available vesicant and/or keratolytics although various studies have also investigated the possibility of using cantharidin as an inflammatory model or in cancer treatment [A32892].

"Pepsin is a potent enzyme in gastric juice that digests proteins such as those in meat, eggs, seeds, and dairy products [L2358].

Studies on gastric digestion from 1820-1840 led to the discovery of pepsin as the substance which, in the presence of stomach acid, causes nutrients including meat or coagulated egg whites to dissolve. Soon afterward, it was shown that these protein nutrients were cleaved by pepsin to products called _peptones_ [A32603].

Pepsin is often used as a replacement enzyme for those with pancreatic insufficiency [L2357]. Stimulation of the pancreas and therefore enzymatic digestion of food is a tightly controlled and is a hormonally mediated process. Any changes or conditions affecting metabolic steps for successful digestion and absorption negatively affect pancreatic enzymatic secretion, entry into the intestine, functionality once inside the intestine, and appropriate mixing with foods/nutrients. Many causes of pancreatic insufficiency require that enzyme replacement therapy is started, including cystic fibrosis, pancreatic cancer, acute and chronic pancreatitis, as well as pancreatic surgery [L2357].

Pepsin is approved by the FDA and is used in food at levels not to exceed current good manufacturing practice [L2363].

"Alpha-tocopherol is the primary form of vitamin E that is preferentially used by the human body to meet appropriate dietary requirements. In particular, the RRR-alpha-tocopherol (or sometimes called the d-alpha-tocopherol stereoisomer) stereoisomer is considered the natural formation of alpha-tocopherol and generally exhibits the greatest bioavailability out of all of the alpha-tocopherol stereoisomers. Moreover, manufacturers typically convert the phenol component of the vitamin to esters using acetic or succinic acid, making a compound such as alpha-tocopherol succinate more stable and easier to use in vitamin supplements [A32956, A32957].

Alpha-tocopherol succinate is subsequently most commonly indicated for dietary supplementation in individuals who may demonstrate a genuine deficiency in vitamin E. Vitamin E itself is naturally found in various foods, added to others, or used in commercially available products as a dietary supplement. The recommended dietary allowances (RDAs) for vitamin E alpha-tocopherol are: males = 4 mg (6 IU) females = 4 mg (6 IU) in ages 0-6 months, males = 5 mg (7.5 IU) females = 5 mg (7.5 IU) in ages 7-12 months, males = 6 mg (9 IU) females = 6 mg (9 IU) in ages 1-3 years, males = 7 mg (10.4 IU) females = 7 mg (10.4 IU) in ages 4-8 years, males = 11 mg (16.4 IU) females = 11 mg (16.4 IU) in ages 9-13 years, males = 15 mg (22.4 IU) females = 15 mg (22.4 IU) pregnancy = 15 mg (22.4 IU) lactation = 19 mg (28.4 IU) in ages 14+ years [L2120]. Most individuals obtain adequate vitamin E intake from their diets; genuine vitamin E deficiency is considered to be rare.

Nevertheless, vitamin E is known to be a fat-soluble antioxidant that has the capability to neutralize endogenous free radicals. This biologic action of vitamin E consequently continues to generate ongoing interest and study in whether or not its antioxidant abilities may be used to help assist in preventing or treating a number of different conditions like cardiovascular disease, ocular conditions, diabetes, cancer and more. At the moment, however, there exists a lack of formal data and evidence to support any such additional indications for vitamin E use.

Moreover, although it is generally believed that alpha-tocopherol succinate would naturally demonstrate such general vitamin E-tocopherol pharmacodynamics after undergoing a logical de-esterification in the gut [A32956, A32957], there is ongoing research that proposes that the alpha-tocopherol succinate compound itself is capable of eliciting anti-cancer [L2699, A32959] and inflammation mediation [A32958] activities that are unique from the alpha-tocopherol form and other alpha-tocopherol esters [L2699, A32958, A32959].",alpha-Tocopherol succinate,LU4B53JYVE,[H][C@@](C)(CCCC(C)C)CCC[C@@]([H])(C)CCC[C@]1(C)CCC2=C(C)C(OC(=O)CCC(O)=O)=C(C)C(C)=C2O1,SEC14-like protein 3; SEC14-like protein 2; Nuclear receptor subfamily 1 group I member 2; Protein kinase C beta type; Arachidonate 5-lipoxygenase; Protein kinase C alpha type; Alpha-tocopherol transfer protein; Glutathione S-transferase A2; Glutathione S-transferase P; Glutathione S-transferase omega-1; Glutathione S-transferase Mu 3; Glutamate--cysteine ligase catalytic subunit; NAD(P)H dehydrogenase [quinone] 1; Heme oxygenase 1; Superoxide dismutase [Cu-Zn]; Lung epithelial cells; Diacylglycerol kinase,Q9UDX4; O76054; O75469; P05771; P09917; P17252; P49638; P09210; P09211; P78417; P21266; P48506; P15559; P09601; P00441; ; P23743; Q9Y6T7; Q16760; P52429; Q86XP1; P49619; O75912; Q5KSL6; P52824; Q13574,SEC14L3; SEC14L2; NR1I2; PRKCB; ALOX5; PRKCA; TTPA; GSTA2; GSTP1; GSTO1; GSTM3; GCLC; NQO1; HMOX1; SOD1; ; DGKA; DGKB; DGKD; DGKE; DGKH; DGKG; DGKI; DGKK; DGKQ; DGKZ,true
"Nabiximols (tradename Sativex®) is a whole plant extract from the Cannabis species _Cannabis sativa L._ that has been purified into the active components CBD (cannabidiol) and THC (delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol). For trademark purposes, purified CBD is branded as Nabidiolex®, while THC is purified as the product Tetrabinex®. Sativex® is available in a 1:1 formulation of THC:CBD as an oro-mucosal pump spray used for treatment of neuropathic pain from Multiple Sclerosis (MS) and for intractable cancer pain. Although still largely debated, Cannabis has been shown to have analgesic, anticonvulsant, muscle relaxant, anxiolytic, neuroprotective, anti-oxidant, and anti-psychotic activity [A32477, A32469]. 

From a pharmacological perspective, Cannabis' diverse receptor profile explains its potential application for such a wide variety of medical conditions. Cannabis contains more than 400 different chemical compounds, of which 61 are considered cannabinoids, a class of compounds that act upon cannabinoid receptors of the body [A32584]. Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and cannabidiol (CBD) are two types of cannabinoids found naturally in the resin of the marijuana plant, both of which interact with the cannabinoid receptors found in the human body. While both CBD and THC are used for medicinal purposes, they have different receptor activity, function, and physiological effects. While cannabis in its natural plant form is currently used ""off-label"" for the management of many medical conditions, THC is currently commercially available in synthetic form as [DB00486], as purified isomer as [DB00470], or in a 1:1 formulation with CBD from purified plant extract as [DB14011].

The primary psychoactive component of Cannabis, delta 9-tetrahydrocannabinol (Δ9-THC), demonstrates its effects through weak partial agonist activity at Cannabinoid-1 (CB1R) and Cannabinoid-2 (CB2R) receptors. This activity results in the well-known effects of smoking cannabis such as increased appetite, reduced pain, and changes in emotional and cognitive processes. In contrast to THC's weak agonist activity, CBD has been shown to act as a negative allosteric modulator of the cannabinoid CB1 receptor, the most abundant G-Protein Coupled Receptor (GPCR) in the body [A32469]. Allosteric regulation is achieved through the modulation of receptor activity on a functionally distinct site from the agonist or antagonist binding site. The negative allosteric modulatory effects of CBD are therapeutically important as direct agonists are limited by their psychomimetic effects while direct antagonists are limited by their depressant effects [A32469].

"Melatonin is a biogenic amine that is found in animals, plants and microbes. Aaron B. Lerner of Yale University is credited for naming the hormone and for defining its chemical structure in 1958.  In mammals, melatonin is produced by the pineal gland. The pineal gland is small endocrine gland, about the size of a rice grain and shaped like a pine cone (hence the name), that is located in the center of the brain (rostro-dorsal to the superior colliculus) but outside the blood-brain barrier. The secretion of melatonin increases in darkness and decreases during exposure to light, thereby regulating the circadian rhythms of several biological functions, including the sleep-wake cycle. In particular, melatonin regulates the sleep-wake cycle by chemically causing drowsiness and lowering the body temperature.  Melatonin is also implicated in the regulation of mood, learning and memory, immune activity, dreaming, fertility and reproduction. Melatonin is also an effective antioxidant.  Most of the actions of melatonin are mediated through the binding and activation of melatonin receptors. Individuals with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) may have lower than normal levels of melatonin. A 2008 study found that unaffected parents of individuals with ASD also have lower melatonin levels, and that the deficits were associated with low activity of the ASMT gene, which encodes the last enzyme of melatonin synthesis. Reduced melatonin production has also been proposed as a likely factor in the significantly higher cancer rates in night workers.",Melatonin,JL5DK93RCL,COC1=CC2=C(NC=C2CCNC(C)=O)C=C1,"Acetylserotonin O-methyltransferase; Melatonin receptor type 1A; Melatonin receptor type 1B; Nuclear receptor ROR-beta; Calmodulin; Calreticulin; Ribosyldihydronicotinamide dehydrogenase [quinone]; Myeloperoxidase; Estrogen receptor alpha; Eosinophil peroxidase; Cytochrome P450 1A1; Cytochrome P450 1A2; Cytochrome P450 2C19; Cytochrome P450 2C9; Acetylserotonin O-methyltransferase; Indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase 1; Myeloperoxidase; Cytochrome P450 1B1; Solute carrier family 22 member 8; Cytochrome P450 19A1",P46597; P48039; P49286; Q92753; P0DP23; P27797; P16083; P05164; P03372; P11678; P04798; P05177; P33261; P11712; P14902; Q16678; Q8TCC7; P11511,ASMT; MTNR1A; MTNR1B; RORB; CALM1; CALR; NQO2; MPO; ESR1; EPX; CYP1A1; CYP1A2; CYP2C19; CYP2C9; IDO1; CYP1B1; SLC22A8; CYP19A1,true
"Polyethylene glycol (PEG) is a synthetic polymer produced via polymerization of ethylene oxide molecules to make joining units of ethylene glycol by an ether linkage.[A190975,A190978] PEGs are water-soluble polymers that can form hydrogen bonds in a ratio of 100 water molecules per one PEG molecule.[A190975] Molecular weights of PEGs vary by time of the polymerization process and the molecular weight represents the weighted average of the individual PEG molecules. PEGs differ in their physical and chemical properties depending on their molecular weight: PEGs are liquids when molecular weights are <1000 and the molecule turns to waxy solids with increasing molecular weights.[A190978] The most common preparations of PEGs include PEG 3350 and PEG 400. PEGs have various applications in many fields, ranging from medical to industrial areas. PEGs have a long history of gastroenterology: PEG 3350 is a common over-the-counter osmotic laxative used to relieve occasional constipation.[L11812] PEG 3350 is also used for cleansing of the colon in preparation for colonoscopy in adults.[L6421]

The rationale of using PEG in gastroenterology is due to the physical properties of the compound: its potent water-binding capacity, negligible intestinal absorption with increasing molecular mass, lack of significant toxicity, and limited intestinal enzymatic degradation or bacterial metabolism all make PEG a useful therapeutic agent for the treatment of occasional constipation and bowel cleansing for preparation in colonoscopy.[A18713]",Polyethylene glycol,3WJQ0SDW1A,,P-glycoprotein 1,P08183,ABCB1,true

"Urea 14C is a urea molecule radiolabelled with a radioactive carbon-14. It is currently used for the Urea Breath Test (UBT) and is available as a rapid diagnostic test (marketed as PyTest) for the detection of Helicobacter pylori infections. H pylori is a common stomach bacteria that has been linked to a variety of upper gastrointestinal disorders such as gastritis, gastric and peptic ulcers, stomach cancer, and gastric mucosa-associated lymphoid-tissue (MALT) lymphoma. The UBT is indicated to confirm H. pylori infection and to monitor post-treatment for its eradication. 

Radiolabelled urea is available in two forms as 13C and 14C. Both forms can be used within the Urea Breath Test, however some may prefer 13C as it is non-radioactive compared to 14C, which may be preferable in pregnant women and children.

The Urea Breath Test is based on the ability of the H. pylori enzyme urease to cleave urea into ammonia and carbon dioxide. As the urease enzyme is not present in mammalian cells, the presence of urease (and the products of urea cleavage) in the stomach is evidence that H. pylori bacteria are present.  To detect H. pylori, urea labeled with 14C is swallowed by the patient. If gastric urease from H. pylori is present, urea is split to form CO2 and NH3 at the interface between the gastric epithelium and lumen and 14CO2 is absorbed into the blood and exhaled in the breath.

"Idelalisib is a phosphoinositide 3-kinase inhibitor indicated in the treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), relapsed follicular B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (FL), and relapsed small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL). For the treatment of relapsed CLL, it is currently indicated as a second-line agent in combination with rituximab in patients for whom rituximab alone would be considered appropriate therapy due to other co-morbidities, while in the treatment of FL and SLL it is intended to be used in patients who have received at least two prior systemic therapies. More specifically, idelalisib targets P110δ, the delta isoform of the enzyme phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase, also known as PI-3K. The PI-3Ks are a family of enzymes involved in cellular functions such as cell growth, proliferation, differentiation, motility, survival and intracellular trafficking, which in turn are involved in cancer. In contrast to the other class IA PI3Ks p110α and p110β, p110δ is principally expressed in leukocytes (white blood cells) and is important for the function of T cells, B cell, mast cells and neutrophils. By inhibiting this enzyme, idelalisib induces apoptosis of malignant cells and inhibits several cell signaling pathways, including B-cell receptor (BCR) signaling and C-X-C chemokine receptors type 5 and type 4 signalling, which are involved in trafficking and homing of B-cells to the lymph nodes and bone marrow.

"Osimertinib is an oral, third-generation epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) drug developed by AstraZeneca Pharmaceuticals. Its use is indicated for the treatment of metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in cases where tumour EGFR expression is positive for the T790M mutation as detected by FDA-approved testing and which has progressed following therapy with a first-generation EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor. Approximately 10% of patients with NSCLC have a rapid and clinically effective response to EGFR-TKIs due to the presence of specific activating EGFR mutations within the tumour cells. More specifically, deletions around the LREA motif in exon 19 and exon 21 L858R point mutations are correlated with response to therapy. 

Development of third-generation EGFR-TKIs, such as osimertinib, has been in response to altered tumour resistance patterns following treatment and toxic side effects that impact patient quality of life. Treatment with first-generation EGFR-TKIs (gefitinib and erlotinib) has been associated with the development of resistance through activating mutations in the EGFR gene. Second-generation EGFR-TKIs (afatinib and dacomitinib) were then developed to be more potent inhibitors, although their use is associated with increased toxicity through nonspecific targeting of wild-type EGFR. In contrast, third-generation inhibitors are specific for the gate-keeper T790M mutations which increases ATP binding activity to EGFR and result in poor prognosis for late-stage disease. Furthermore, osimertinib has been shown to spare wild-type EGFR during therapy, thereby reducing non-specific binding and limiting toxicity.",Osimertinib,3C06JJ0Z2O,COC1=C(NC2=NC=CC(=N2)C2=CN(C)C3=C2C=CC=C3)C=C(NC(=O)C=C)C(=C1)N(C)CCN(C)C,Epidermal growth factor receptor; P-glycoprotein 1; ATP-binding cassette sub-family G member 2; Cytochrome P450 3A4; Cytochrome P450 1A2,P00533; P08183; Q9UNQ0; P08684; P05177,EGFR; ABCB1; ABCG2; CYP3A4; CYP1A2,true

"Macimorelin, a novel and orally active ghrelin mimetic that stimulates GH secretion, is used in the diagnosis of adult GH deficiency (AGHD). More specifically, macimorelin is a peptidomimetic growth hormone secretagogue (GHS) that acts as an agonist of GH secretagogue receptor, or ghrelin receptor (GHS-R1a) to dose-dependently increase GH levels [A31481]. Growth hormone secretagogues (GHS) represent a new class of pharmacological agents which have the potential to be used in numerous clinical applications. They include treatment for growth retardation in children and cachexia associated with chronic disease such as AIDS and cancer. 

Growth hormone (GH) is classically linked with linear growth during childhood. In deficiency of this hormone, AGHD is commonly associated with increased fat mass (particularly in the abdominal region), decreased lean body mass, osteopenia, dyslipidemia, insulin resistance, and/or glucose intolerance overtime. In addition, individuals with may be susceptible to cardiovascular complications from altered structures and function [A31484]. Risk factors of AGHD include a history of childhood-onset GH deficiency or with hypothalamic/pituitary disease, surgery, or irradiation to these areas, head trauma, or evidence of other pituitary hormone deficiencies [A31481]. While there are various therapies available such as GH replacement therapy, the absence of panhypopituitarism and low serum IGF-I levels with nonspecific clinical symptoms pose challenges to the detection and diagnosis of AGHD. The diagnosis of AGHD requires biochemical confirmation with at least 1 GH stimulation test [A31481]. Macimorelin is clinically useful since it displays good stability and oral bioavailability with comparable affinity to ghrelin receptor as its endogenous ligand. In clinical studies involving healthy subjects, macimorelin stimulated GH release in a dose-dependent manner with good tolerability [A31481].

Also known as ACP-196, acalabrutinib is also considered a second generation BTK inhibitor because it was rationally designed to be more potent and selective than ibrutinib, theoretically expected to demonstrate fewer adverse effects owing to minimized bystander effects on targets other than BTK.

Nevertheless, acalabrutinib was approved under the FDA's accelerated approval pathway, which is based upon overall response rate and faciliates earlier approval of medicines that treat serious conditions or/and that fill an unmet medical need based on a surrogate endpoint.

"Alpha-tocopherol is the primary form of vitamin E that is preferentially used by the human body to meet appropriate dietary requirements. In particular, the RRR-alpha-tocopherol (or sometimes called the d-alpha-tocopherol stereoisomer) stereoisomer is considered the natural formation of alpha-tocopherol and generally exhibits the greatest bioavailability out of all of the alpha-tocopherol stereoisomers. Moreover, RRR-alpha-tocopherol acetate is a relatively stabilized form of vitamin E that is most commonly used as a food additive when needed [A32451].

Alpha-tocopherol acetate is subsequently most commonly indicated for dietary supplementation in individuals who may demonstrate a genuine deficiency in vitamin E. Vitamin E itself is naturally found in various foods, added to others, or used in commercially available products as a dietary supplement. The recommended dietary allowances (RDAs) for vitamin E alpha-tocopherol are: males = 4 mg (6 IU) females = 4 mg (6 IU) in ages 0-6 months, males = 5 mg (7.5 IU) females = 5 mg (7.5 IU) in ages 7-12 months, males = 6 mg (9 IU) females = 6 mg (9 IU) in ages 1-3 years, males = 7 mg (10.4 IU) females = 7 mg (10.4 IU) in ages 4-8 years, males = 11 mg (16.4 IU) females = 11 mg (16.4 IU) in ages 9-13 years, males = 15 mg (22.4 IU) females = 15 mg (22.4 IU) pregnancy = 15 mg (22.4 IU) lactation = 19 mg (28.4 IU) in ages 14+ years [L2120]. Most individuals obtain adequate vitamin E intake from their diets; genuine vitamin E deficiency is considered to be rare.

Nevertheless, vitamin E is known to be a fat-soluble antioxidant that has the capability to neutralize endogenous free radicals.

"Dronabinol (marketed as Marinol) is a synthetic form of delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (Δ⁹-THC), the primary psychoactive component of cannabis (marijuana). THC demonstrates its effects through weak partial agonist activity at Cannabinoid-1 (CB1R) and Cannabinoid-2 (CB2R) receptors, which results in the well-known effects of smoking cannabis such as increased appetite, reduced pain, and changes in emotional and cognitive processes. Due to its evidence as an appetite stimulant and an anti-nauseant, Dronabinol is approved for use in anorexia associated with weight loss in patients with AIDS and for the treatment of nausea and vomiting associated with cancer chemotherapy in patients who have failed to respond adequately to conventional antiemetic treatments [FDA Label].

Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and cannabidiol (CBD) are the two most abundant cannabinoids found naturally in the resin of the marijuana plant, both of which are pharmacologically active due to their interaction with cannabinoid receptors that are found throughout the body [A32830]. While both CBD and THC are used for medicinal purposes, they have different receptor activity, function, and physiological effects. If not provided in their activated form (such as through synthetic forms like Dronabinol or [DB00486]), THC and CBD are obtained through conversion from their precursors, tetrahydrocannabinolic acid-A (THCA-A) and cannabidiolic acid (CBDA), through decarboxylation reactions. This can be achieved through heating, smoking, vaporization, or baking of dried unfertilized female cannabis flowers.

From a pharmacological perspective, Cannabis' diverse receptor profile explains its potential application for such a wide variety of medical conditions. Cannabis contains more than 400 different chemical compounds, of which 61 are considered cannabinoids, a class of compounds that act upon endogenous cannabinoid receptors of the body [A32584]. The endocannabinoid system is widely distributed throughout the central and peripheral nervous system (via the Cannabinoid Receptors CB1 and CB2) and plays a role in many physiological processes such as inflammation, cardiovascular function, learning, pain, memory, stress and emotional regulation, and the sleep/wake cycle among many others [A32824]. CB1 receptors are found in both the central and peripheral nervous system, and are most abundant in the hippocampus and amygdala, which are the areas of the brain responsible for short-term memory storage and emotional regulation. CB2 receptors are mainly located in the peripheral nervous system and can be found on lymphoid tissue where they are involved in regulation of immune function [A32676].",Dronabinol,7J8897W37S,[H][C@@]12C=C(C)CC[C@@]1([H])C(C)(C)OC1=C2C(O)=CC(CCCCC)=C1,Cannabinoid receptor 1; Cytochrome P450 3A4; Cytochrome P450 2C9; Cannabinoid receptor 2; P-glycoprotein 1; ATP-binding cassette sub-family G member 2; Prostaglandin G/H synthase 1; Cytochrome P450 2C19; Cytochrome P450 1A1; Cytochrome P450 1A2; Cytochrome P450 1B1; Cytochrome P450 2A6; Cytochrome P450 2B6; Cytochrome P450 2D6; Cytochrome P450 2J2; Cytochrome P450 3A5; Cytochrome P450 3A7; Multidrug resistance-associated protein 1; Liver carboxylesterase 1,P21554; P08684; P11712; P34972; P08183; Q9UNQ0; P23219; P33261; P04798; P05177; Q16678; P11509; P20813; P10635; P51589; P20815; P24462; P33527; P23141,CNR1; CYP3A4; CYP2C9; CNR2; ABCB1; ABCG2; PTGS1; CYP2C19; CYP1A1; CYP1A2; CYP1B1; CYP2A6; CYP2B6; CYP2D6; CYP2J2; CYP3A5; CYP3A7; ABCC1; CES1,true
"Amifampridine, or 3,4-diaminopyridine (3,4-DAP), is a quaternary ammonium compound that blocks presynaptic potassium channels, and subsequently prolongs the action potential and increases presynaptic calcium concentrations [A33863]. It was first discovered in Scotland in the 1970s and its clinical effectiveness for neuromuscular disorders, including Lambert–Eaton myasthenic syndrome (LEMS), has been investigated in the 1980s [L3171]. Amifampridine phosphate is a more stable salt that serves as an active ingredient of EMA-approved Firdapse, which was previously marketed as Zenas. It is currently used as the first-line symptomatic treatment for LEMS in adult patients and is ideally given as oral tablets in divided doses, three or four times a day. Firdapse (amifampridine) was formally approved by the US FDA for the treatment of adults with LEMS as recently as November of 2018 [L4819].

LEMS is a rare auto-immune disorder of the neuromuscular junction that is characterized by proximal muscle weakness, depressed tendon reflexes, and posttetanic potentiation in addition to autonomic dysfunction [A33863]. About 50-60% of the patients develop more rapidly progressive LEMS and small cell lung cancer, which influences the prognosis [A33863]. Patients with LEMS develop serum antibodies against presynaptic P/Q-type voltage-gated calcium channels, leading to decreased presynaptic calcium levels and reduced quantal release of acetylcholine, which is mainly responsible for causing symptoms of LEMS [A33863]. Reduced acetylcholine release at the neuromuscular junction leads to decreased frequency of miniature endplate potentials of normal amplitude, and insufficient acetylcholine levels for the activation of postsynaptic muscle fibers following a single nerve impulse [A33863]. This leads to the reduction of the compound muscle action potential (CMAP) [A33863]. Treatment for LEMS include immunotherapy such as conventional immunosuppression or intravenous immunoglobulins, however such treatments are recommended in patients in whom symptomatic treatment would not suffice [A33863]. Amifampridine is the nonimmune treatment options for LEMS. 

In phase III clinical trials of adult patients with LEMS, treatment of amifampridine significantly improved symptoms of LEMS compared to placebo with good tolerance [A33864]. It was demonstrated in clinical studies involving healthy volunteers that the pharmacokinetics and systemic exposure to amifampridine is affected by the genetic differences in N-acetyl-transferase (NAT) enzymes (acetylator phenotype) and NAT2 genotype, which is subject to genetic variation [F272]. Slow acetylators were at higher risk for experiencing drug-associated adverse reactions, such as paresthesias, nausea, and headache [F272].",Amifampridine,RU4S6E2G0J,NC1=CC=NC=C1N,Arylamine N-acetyltransferase 1; Arylamine N-acetyltransferase 2; Potassium voltage-gated channel subfamily A member 1,P18440; P11245; Q09470,NAT1; NAT2; KCNA1,true

"Tramadol is a centrally acting synthetic opioid analgesic and SNRI (serotonin/norepinephrine reuptake-inhibitor) that is structurally related to [codeine] and [morphine]. Due to its good tolerability profile and multimodal mechanism of action, tramadol is generally considered a lower-risk opioid option for the treatment of moderate to severe pain. It is considered a Step 2 option on the World Health Organization's pain ladder and has about 1/10th of the potency of [morphine]. 

Tramadol differs from other traditional opioid medications in that it doesn't just act as a μ-opioid agonist, but also affects monoamines by modulating the effects of neurotransmitters involved in the modulation of pain such as serotonin and norepinpehrine which activate descending pain inhibitory pathways.[A182279] Tramadol's effects on serotonin and norepinephrine mimic the effects of other SNRI antidepressants such as [duloxetine] and [venlafaxine].

Tramadol exists as a racemic mixture consisting of two pharmacologically active enantiomers that both contribute to its analgesic property through different mechanisms and are also themselves metabolized into active metabolites: (+)-tramadol and its primary metabolite (+)-O-desmethyl-tramadol (M1) are agonists of the μ opioid receptor while (+)-tramadol inhibits serotonin reuptake and (-)-tramadol inhibits norepinephrine reuptake. These pathways are complementary and synergistic, improving tramadol's ability to modulate the perception of and response to pain.[A4269,A183842] 

Tramadol has also been shown to affect a number of other pain modulators within the central nervous system as well as non-neuronal inflammatory markers and immune mediators.[A183728,A183734,A183761,A17159,A182300] Due to the broad spectrum of targets involved in pain and inflammation, it's not surprising that the evidence has shown that tramadol is effective for a number of pain types including neuropathic pain, post-operative pain, lower back pain, as well as pain associated with labour, osteoarthritis, fibromyalgia, and cancer. Due to its SNRI activity, tramadol also has anxiolytic, antidepressant, and anti-shivering effects which are all frequently found as comorbidities with pain.[A182300]

Similar to other opioid medications, tramadol poses a risk for development of tolerance, dependence and abuse. If used in higher doses, or with other opioids, there is a dose-related risk of overdose, respiratory depression, and death.[A183830,F4679] However, unlike other opioid medications, tramadol use also carries a risk of seizure and serotonin syndrome, particularly if used with other serotonergic medications.[A183836,A179926]",Tramadol,39J1LGJ30J,COC1=CC=CC(=C1)C1(O)CCCCC1CN(C)C,Mu-type opioid receptor; Sodium-dependent noradrenaline transporter; 5-hydroxytryptamine receptor 2C; Kappa-type opioid receptor; Sodium-dependent serotonin transporter; Cytochrome P450 2D6; Delta-type opioid receptor; Cytochrome P450 3A4; Cytochrome P450 2B6; Alpha-7 nicotinic cholinergic receptor subunit; Muscarinic acetylcholine receptor M3; Muscarinic acetylcholine receptor M1; UDP-glucuronosyltransferase 1-1; Neurokinin 1 receptor; Sodium channel protein type 2 subunit alpha; Transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily V member 1; NMDA receptor; Adenosine receptor A1; Alpha-2 adrenergic receptors,P35372; P23975; P28335; P41145; P31645; P10635; P41143; P08684; P20813; Q693P7; P20309; P11229; P22309; P25103; Q99250; Q8NER1; Q05586; Q12879; Q13224; Q14957; O15399; Q8TCU5; O60391; P30542; P08913; P18089; P18825,OPRM1; SLC6A2; HTR2C; OPRK1; SLC6A4; CYP2D6; OPRD1; CYP3A4; CYP2B6; CHRNA7; CHRM3; CHRM1; UGT1A1; TACR1; SCN2A; TRPV1; GRIN1; GRIN2A; GRIN2B; GRIN2C; GRIN2D; GRIN3A; GRIN3B; ADORA1; ADRA2A; ADRA2B; ADRA2C,true
"Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), including ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease, is typified by a chronic gastrointestinal inflammatory microenvironment, driven in part by the excessive infiltration and retention of intestinal-homing lymphocytes.[A244564, A244569, A244579, A244584] A recent class of drugs designed to impair lymphocyte homing, so-called ""anti-trafficking agents"" (ATAs), have shown some success and include approved drugs such as [natalizumab] and [vedolizumab], which target integrins and impair their interaction with adhesion molecules on epithelial cells.[A244574] In the case of [natalizumab], which targets the α4 integrin subunit, this has also resulted in undesirable blockade of lymphocyte CNS trafficking and reported cases of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML).[A244564, A244584] Etrolizumab is a humanized IgG1κ monoclonal antibody directed against the β7 subunit of gastrointestinal α4β7 and αEβ7 integrins that, due to its target specificity, appears as or more efficacious than [vedolizumab] and without the CNS effects of [natalizumab].[A244564, A244569, A244574, A244584]

"Carbon monoxide (CO) is a colorless, odorless, and tasteless gas that has a slightly lower density than air. It is toxic to hemoglobin utilizing animals (including humans), when encountered in concentrations above about 35 ppm, although it is also formed in normal animal metabolism in low quantities, and is thought to have some normal biological/homeostatic functions [L2529]. Carbon monoxide (CO), is a ubiquitous environmental product of organic combustion, which is also formed endogenously in the human body, as the byproduct of heme metabolism [A32758]. Exhaled CO (eCO), similar to exhaled nitric oxide (eNO), has been evaluated as a candidate breath biomarker of pathophysiological states, including smoking status, and inflammatory diseases of the lung and other organs. Exhalation of corbon monoxide values have been studied as potential indicators of inflammation in asthma, stable COPD and exacerbations, cystic fibrosis, lung cancer, and during surgery or critical care [L2529].

A test of the diffusing capacity of the lungs for carbon monoxide (DLCO), is one of the most clinically valuable tests of lung function testing. The technique was first described  100 years ago, and applied to clinical practice many years after. The DLCO measures the ability of the lungs to transfer gas from inhaled air to the red blood cells in pulmonary capillaries. The DLCO test is both convenient and simple for the patient to undergo. The ten seconds of breath-holding required for the DLCO maneuver is easier for most patients to perform than the forced exhalation required for other respiratory tests [L2557].

Carbon monoxide is presently used in small amounts in low oxygen modified atmosphere packaging systems (MAP) for fresh meat to stabilize and maintain natural meat color. This use of CO has been generally recognized as safe (GRAS) in several packaging applications for fresh meat products. Since 2002, FDA has favorably reviewed three GRAS notifications for carbon monoxide use in fresh meat packaging [L2537]. The FDA classifies this drug as permitted as a food additive in the packaging and preparation of food products, while following the federal code of regulations [L2531].

There have been several concerns voiced of over the use of carbon monoxide in food products [L2537], [L2538], [L2539]. The European Union has banned the use of carbon monoxide as a color stabilizer in meat and fish. A December 2001 report from the European Commission's Scientific Committee on Food concluded that the gas did not pose a risk provided that food was maintained adequately cold during storage and transport to prevent the growth of microorganisms [L2538].  In New Zealand, the use of carbon monoxide in fish preparation has been banned, as it may mask the effects of food spoilage and bacterial growth [L2539].",Carbon monoxide,7U1EE4V452,,Myoglobin,P02144,MB,true
"Tetrahydrocannabivarin (THCV) is a propyl analogue of tetrahydrocannabinol (Δ9-THC), one of the primary pharmacological components of [Medical Cannabis]. Δ9-THC is currently available in several synthetic forms, including [Dronabinol], while purified or isolated THCV is not approved for any medical uses and is not available as any marketed products. As a major phytocannabinoid, however, THCV is accessible within [Medical Cannabis] along with other identified cannabinoids including [Cannabidiol] (CBD), [cannabinol] (CBN), [cannabigerol] (CBG), [cannabichromene] (CBC), [cannabivarin] (CBV), and [Cannabidivarin] (CBDV). 

THCV is one of four cannabinoids with identified potential as anticonvulsant agents, which also includes Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinolic acid, [Cannabidiol] (CBD), and [Cannabidivarin] (CBDV) [A33334].

Although THCV possesses an almost identical structure to Δ9-THC (varying only by the length of its lipophilic alkyl chain), it has different molecular targets and pharmacological profile [A32972]. Compared to THC which demonstrates its effects through weak partial agonist activity of both endocannabinoid receptors Cannabinoid-1 (CB1R) and Cannabinoid-2 (CB2R), THCV acts as a CB1 antagonist and a partial agonist of CB2 [A32477]. Further evidence has also shown that THCV acts as an agonist of GPR55 and l-α-lysophosphatidylinositol (LPI) [A32974]. Beyond the endocannabinoid system, THCV has also been reported to activate 5HT1A receptors to produce an antipsychotic effect that has therapeutic potential for ameliorating some of the negative, cognitive and positive symptoms of schizophrenia [A32975]. Furthermore, THCV interacts with different transient receptor potential (TRP) channels including TRPV2, which may contribute to the analgesic, anti-inflammatory and anti-cancer effects of cannabinoids and Cannabis extracts [A32976]. It has also shown antiepileptiform and anticonvulsant properties, that suggest possible therapeutic application in the treatment of pathophysiologic hyperexcitability states such as untreatable epilepsy [A33325].

Cannabinoid receptors are utilized endogenously by the body through the endocannabinoid system, which includes a group of lipid proteins, enzymes, and receptors that are involved in many physiological processes. Through its modulation of neurotransmitter release, the endocannabinoid system regulates cognition, pain sensation, appetite, memory, sleep, immune function, and mood among many others. These effects are largely mediated through two members of the G-protein coupled receptor family, cannabinoid receptors 1 and 2 (CB1 and CB2)[A32585]. CB1 receptors are found in both the central and peripheral nervous systems, with the majority of receptors localized to the hippocampus and amygdala of the brain. Physiological effects of using cannabis make sense in the context of its receptor activity as the hippocampus and amygdala are primarily involved with regulation of memory, fear, and emotion. In contrast, CB2 receptors are mainly found peripherally in immune cells, lymphoid tissue, and peripheral nerve terminals [A32676].

Reliably studying the effects of Cannabis (and of THCV) is complicated by the numerous other compounds that Cannabis contains such as terpenes, flavonoids, phenols, amino acids, and fatty acids among many others that have the potential to modulate the plant's pharmacological effect [A32832,A32824].",Tetrahydrocannabivarin,I5YE3I47D8,CCCC1=CC(O)=C2[C@@H]3C=C(C)CC[C@H]3C(C)(C)OC2=C1,Cannabinoid receptor 1; Cannabinoid receptor 2; G-protein coupled receptor 55; 5-hydroxytryptamine receptor 1A; Transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily V member 2; Transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily M member 8; Transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily A member 1,P21554; P34972; Q9Y2T6; P08908; Q9Y5S1; Q7Z2W7; O75762,CNR1; CNR2; GPR55; HTR1A; TRPV2; TRPM8; TRPA1,false
"Nabilone (marketed as Cesamet) is a synthetic form of delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (Δ⁹-THC), the primary psychoactive component of cannabis (marijuana). Although structurally distinct from THC, nabilone mimics THC's structure and pharmacological activity through weak partial agonist activity at Cannabinoid-1 (CB1R) and Cannabinoid-2 (CB2R) receptors, however it is considered to be twice as active as Δ⁹-THC. Nabilone is approved by the FDA for the treatment of nausea and vomiting associated with cancer chemotherapy in patients who have failed to respond adequately to conventional antiemetic treatments [FDA Label].

Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and cannabidiol (CBD) are the two most abundant cannabinoids found naturally in the resin of the marijuana plant, both of which are pharmacologically active due to their interaction with cannabinoid receptors that are found throughout the body [A32830]. While both CBD and THC are used for medicinal purposes, they have different receptor activity, function, and physiological effects. If not provided in their activated form (such as through synthetic forms like Nabilone or [DB00470]), THC and CBD are obtained through conversion from their precursors, tetrahydrocannabinolic acid-A (THCA-A) and cannabidiolic acid (CBDA), through decarboxylation reactions. This can be achieved through heating, smoking, vaporization, or baking of dried unfertilized female cannabis flowers.

From a pharmacological perspective, Cannabis' diverse receptor profile explains its potential application for such a wide variety of medical conditions. Cannabis contains more than 400 different chemical compounds, of which 61 are considered cannabinoids, a class of compounds that act upon endogenous cannabinoid receptors of the body [A32584]. The endocannabinoid system is widely distributed throughout the central and peripheral nervous system (via the Cannabinoid Receptors CB1 and CB2) and plays a role in many physiological processes such as inflammation, cardiovascular function, learning, pain, memory, stress and emotional regulation, and the sleep/wake cycle among many others [A32824]. CB1 receptors are found in both the central and peripheral nervous system, and are most abundant in the hippocampus and amygdala, which are the areas of the brain responsible for short-term memory storage and emotional regulation. CB2 receptors are mainly located in the peripheral nervous system and can be found on lymphoid tissue where they are involved in regulation of immune function [A32676].

In Canada, the United States, the United Kingdom and Mexico, nabilone is marketed as Cesamet. It was approved in 1985 by the United States FDA for treatment of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting that has not responded to conventional antiemetics. Though it was approved by the FDA in 1985, the drug only began marketing in the United States in 2006. It is also approved for use in treatment of anorexia and weight loss in patients with AIDS.

"Recombinant zoster vaccine, manufactured as the product Shingrix by GlaxoSmithKline, is an adjuvanted non-live recombinant vaccine indicated for prevention of shingles. First approved in October 2017 by the Food and Drug Administration, Shingrix is the preferred vaccine for preventing varicella zoster infection in people aged 50 years and older, replacing Zostavax as first line therapy[L1038]. 

Herpes zoster, also known as shingles, is caused by a reactivation of Varicella Zoster Virus (VZV), the virus that commonly causes Chickenpox in childhood. Following initial infection of VZV and resolution of Chickenpox as a child, VZV then lies dormant within the dorsal root ganglion of the central nervous sytem. Decades later, when the body's immune system weakens with age, VZV is able to reactivate and descend through the nerve cells to the surface of the skin where it causes a painful blistering rash. Risk factors for developing shingles include old age, with rates increasing substantially in person's over the age of 50, low immune function or immunosuppression, psychological stress, and diabetes. Person's living with HIV or cancer, those taking immunosuppressants, and transplant recipients are particularly at risk [L1037]. 

One of the most common complications associated with shingles is the development of Post-Herpetic Neuralgia (PHN), a persistant severe nerve pain that develops as a result of chronic pain from shingles lesions. PHN can last for days, months, or even years following resolution of shingles. Other complications also include bacterial infection, spread of the shingles rash to the eye (herpes zoster ophthalmicus) or ear, nerve palsies, or spread of VZV to non-immune persons via contact with varicella lesions.

There are numerous advantages to using Shingrix over Zostavax. Clinical trials for Shingrix have shown greater than 90% efficacy in adults aged 50 and older, with 89% efficacy in preventing postherpetic neuralgia in patients 70 years and older and 91% efficacy in patients 50-70 years of age [FDA Label]. This is a significant improvement over its predecessor, Zostavax, which reduces the risk of shingles by only 51% and the risk of post-herpetic neuralgia by 67% [A31349]. Efficacy of Zostavax also wanes over time, with protection against shingles and PHN lasting only around 5 years. Furthermore, because Shingrix is an inactivated vaccine it can also be used to prevent shingles and PHN in individuals with suppressed immune systems, who are already at increased risk of developing shingles, while Zostavax, a live attenuated vaccine, is contraindicated.

The main immunological component of Shingrix vaccine is glycoprotein E (gE), a protein found on the surface of varicella zoster virus (VZV). Immune exposure to gE protein stimulates the development of anti-gE antibodies, and therefore adaptive immunity to VZV. Shingrix also contains an adjuvant system, AS01B, which is intended to enhance the immunological response to the vaccine leading to longer lasting and greater immunogenicity to the herpes zoster virus [L1036].",Varicella zoster vaccine (recombinant),COB9FF6I46,,"","","",true
"Live attenuated zoster vaccine is available as two products: Zostavax for the prevention of shingles in immunocompetent people over the age of 50, and Varivax for the prevention of chickenpox in individuals 12 months of age and older. While the two vaccines contain the same immunological components and provide protection against the same virus, Zostavax contains a higher dose and is used in older adults to prevent the development of shingles and post-herpetic neuralgia. 

First approved in May 2006 by the Food and Drug Administration, Zostavax was the first vaccine available for the prevention of shingles. Since October 2017, however, it has been replaced as first line therapy by Shingrix ([DB13924]), a more effective and longer lasting vaccine[L1038]. Both Varivax and Zostavax are composed of a lyophilized preparation of live, attenuated Oka/Merck strain of varicella-zoster virus.

"Polyethylene glycols (PEGs) are products made of condensed ethylene oxide and water that can contain various derivatives and have various functions. Because many PEG types are hydrophilic, they are favorably used as enhancers of penetration, and used heavily in topical dermatological preparations. PEGs, along with their many nonionic derivatives, are widely utilized in cosmetic products as surfactants, emulsifiers, cleansing agents, humectants, and skin conditioners.[L1787]

Polyethylene glycol 400 (PEG 400) is a low-molecular-weight grade of polyethylene glycol with a low-level toxicity. It is very hydrophilic, which renders it a useful ingredient in drug formulations to augment the solubility and bioavailability of weakly water-soluble drugs. It is used in ophthalmic solutions for the relief of burning, irritation and/or discomfort that follows dryness of the eye [L1785]. PEG ""400"" indicates that the average molecular weight of the specific PEG is 400 [L1788].

"Indometacin, or indomethacin, is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) with anti-inflammatory, analgesic, and antipyretic properties. NSAIDs consist of agents that are structurally unrelated; the NSAID chemical classification of indometacin is an indole-acetic acid derivative with the chemical name 1- (p-chlorobenzoyl)25-methoxy-2-methylindole-3-acetic acid.[A177871] The pharmacological effect of indometacin is not fully understood, however, it is thought to be mediated through potent and nonselective inhibition of the enzyme cyclooxygenase (COX), which is the main enzyme responsible for catalyzes the rate-limiting step in prostaglandin and thromboxane biosynthesis via the arachidonic acid (AA) pathway. Indometacin was first discovered in 1963 and it was first approved for use in the U.S. by the Food and Drug Administration in 1965, [A486] along with other acetic acid derivatives such as [diclofenac] and [sulindac] that were also developed during the 1960s.[A177871] Since then, indometacin has been extensively studied in clinical trials as one of the most potent NSAIDs in blocking prostaglandin synthesis and was among the first NSAIDs to be used in the symptomatic treatment of migraine and for headaches that eventually became known as “indomethacin-responsive” headache disorders.[A177871] 

Most commonly used in rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, osteoarthritis, acute shoulder pains, and acute gouty arthritis, indometacin is currently available as oral capsules as well as other methods of administration, including rectal and intravenous formulations. Intravenous indometacin is administered to close a hemodynamically significant patent ductus arteriosus, as indicated by clinical evidence, in premature infants.[L10553] Ophthalmic indometacin has been studied and used in the symptomatic treatment of postoperative ocular inflammation and pain and/or complications after cataract surgery. Although deemed effective in reducing ocular inflammation in clinical studies, topical NSAIDs were also associated with a potential reduction in corneal sensitivity accompanied by an increased risk of superficial punctate keratitis and subjective symptoms of discomfort, including pain, burning or pricking, or a tingling sensation after instillation into the cul‐de‐sac.[A177949]",Indomethacin,XXE1CET956,COC1=CC2=C(C=C1)N(C(=O)C1=CC=C(Cl)C=C1)C(C)=C2CC(O)=O,"Prostaglandin G/H synthase 1; Prostaglandin G/H synthase 2; Cytochrome P450 2C19; UDP-glucuronosyltransferase 1-9; Phospholipase A2, membrane associated; Prostaglandin reductase 2; Lactoylglutathione lyase; Prostaglandin D2 receptor 2; Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma; Serum albumin; Canalicular multispecific organic anion transporter 2; Multidrug resistance-associated protein 4; Multidrug resistance-associated protein 6; P-glycoprotein 1; Multidrug resistance-associated protein 1; Solute carrier organic anion transporter family member 1A2; Solute carrier family 22 member 6; Solute carrier family 22 member 8; Canalicular multispecific organic anion transporter 1; ATP-binding cassette sub-family C member 11; Solute carrier family 22 member 11; Sodium/bile acid cotransporter; Solute carrier family 22 member 7; Cytochrome P450 2C9; UDP-glucuronosyltransferase 1-1; Liver carboxylesterase 1; UDP-glucuronosyltransferase 2B7; Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha; Aldo-keto reductase family 1 member C3; Solute carrier organic anion transporter family member 1B1; Bile salt export pump; Interferon-induced, double-stranded RNA-activated protein kinase; Human Cyclooxygenases",P23219; P35354; P33261; O60656; P14555; Q8N8N7; Q04760; Q9Y5Y4; P37231; P02768; O15438; O15439; O95255; P08183; P33527; P46721; Q4U2R8; Q8TCC7; Q92887; Q96J66; Q9NSA0; Q14973; Q9Y694; P11712; P22309; P23141; P16662; Q07869; P42330; Q9Y6L6; O95342; P19525; P23219; P35354,PTGS1; PTGS2; CYP2C19; UGT1A9; PLA2G2A; PTGR2; GLO1; PTGDR2; PPARG; ALB; ABCC3; ABCC4; ABCC6; ABCB1; ABCC1; SLCO1A2; SLC22A6; SLC22A8; ABCC2; ABCC11; SLC22A11; SLC10A1; SLC22A7; CYP2C9; UGT1A1; CES1; UGT2B7; PPARA; AKR1C3; SLCO1B1; ABCB11; EIF2AK2; PTGS1; PTGS2,true

"Novartis' brand name Zelnorm (tegaserod) had originally received approval from the US FDA in 2002 for the treatment of irritable bowel syndrome with constipation (IBS-C).[L5918,F4229] It was, however, voluntarily withdrawn from widespread use in the US market in 2007 after concerns arose over the possibility that tegaserod could potentially cause dangerous cardiovascular events in patients.[L5918,F4229] Since then, closer evaluations of the original data suggesting such cardiovascular risk have resulted in the limited reintroduction or 're-approval' of tegaserod for treatment of IBS-C specifically in female patients less than 65 years of age and whom are considered to be at a lower risk of a cardiovascular event than the broader population.[L5918,F4229] Zelnorm (tegaserod) by Sloan Pharma subsequently gained re-approval in April of 2019.[L5918] Nevertheless, tegaserod remains un-approved in certain regions.[F4226]

Despite the relative complications involved in its history of regulatory approval, ever since its first introduction in 2002 tegaserod remains the only therapy for IBS-C that possesses the unique mechanism of action of acting on serotonin-4 (5-HT(4)) receptors in smooth muscle cells and in the gastrointestinal wall to facilitate actions like esophageal relaxation, peristaltic gut movement, and natural secretions in the gut, among others.[L5918,A11044,A176762,F4229,F4223]",Tegaserod,458VC51857,CCCCCNC(=N)N\N=C\C1=CNC2=C1C=C(OC)C=C2,5-hydroxytryptamine receptor 4; 5-hydroxytryptamine receptor 2B; 5-hydroxytryptamine receptor 2C; 5-hydroxytryptamine receptor 2A; Sodium-dependent serotonin transporter; Cytochrome P450 1A2; Cytochrome P450 2C8; Cytochrome P450 2D6; Cytochrome P450 2E1; ATP-binding cassette sub-family G member 2; P-glycoprotein 1,Q13639; P41595; P28335; P28223; P31645; P05177; P10632; P10635; P05181; Q9UNQ0; P08183,HTR4; HTR2B; HTR2C; HTR2A; SLC6A4; CYP1A2; CYP2C8; CYP2D6; CYP2E1; ABCG2; ABCB1,true
"Methadone is a potent synthetic analgesic that works as a full µ-opioid receptor (MOR) agonist and N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist. As a full MOR agonist, methadone mimics the natural effects of the body's opioids, endorphins, and enkephalins through the release of neurotransmitters involved in pain transmission. It also has a number of unique characteristics that have led to its increased use in the last two decades; in particular, methadone has a lower risk of neuropsychiatric toxicity compared to other opioids (due to a lack of active metabolites), minimal accumulation in renal failure, good bioavailability, low cost, and a long duration of action.[F4685,F4688,F4691,A185885,A185900,A185903] 

Due to its unique mechanism of action, methadone is particularly useful for the management of hard to treat pain syndromes such as neuropathic pain and cancer pain requiring higher and more frequent doses of shorter-acting opioids.[A185888,A185891,A185897] Compared with [morphine], the gold standard reference opioid, methadone also acts as an agonist of κ- and σ-opioid receptors, as an antagonist of the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor, and as an inhibitor of serotonin and norepinephrine uptake.[A497,A5344] Specifically by inhibiting the NMDA receptor, methadone dampens a major excitatory pain pathway within the central nervous system.[A185876] Compared to other opioids, methadone's effects on NMDA inhibition may explain it's improved analgesic efficacy and reduced opioid tolerance.[A185891,A185894]

Methadone shares similar effects and risks of other opioids such as [morphine], [hydromorphone], [oxycodone], and [fentanyl]. However, it also has a unique pharmacokinetic profile. Compared with short-acting and even extended-release formulations of [morphine], methadone displays a comparatively longer duration of action and half-life. These effects make methadone a good option for the treatment of severe pain and addiction as fewer doses are needed to maintain analgesia and prevent opioid withdrawal symptoms. However, methadone also has an unpredictable half-life with interindividual variability, which leads to an unpredictable risk of respiratory depression and overdose when initiating or titrating therapy.[A183995]

Overall, methadone's pharmacological actions result in analgesia, suppression of opioid withdrawal symptoms, sedation, miosis, sweating, hypotension, bradycardia, nausea and vomiting (via binding within the chemoreceptor trigger zone), and constipation. At higher doses, methadone use can result in respiratory depression, overdose, and death.[F4685,F4688,F4691]

Treatment of opioid addiction with methadone, [buprenorphine], or slow-release oral [morphine] (SROM) is termed Opioid Agonist Treatment (OAT) or Opioid Substitution Therapy (OST). The intention of substitution of illicit opioids with the long-acting opioids used in OAT is to prevent withdrawal symptoms for 24-36 hours following dosing to ultimately reduce cravings and drug-seeking behaviours. Use of OAT is also intended to lead to social stabilization by reducing crime rates, incarceration, use of illicit opioids such as [heroin] or [fentanyl], and ultimately marginalization.[A185882] Illegally purchased opioids present many other harms in addition to overdose as they can be injected and may be laced with other substances that increase the risk of harm or overdose. Provision of OAT is often combined with education about harm reduction including use of clean needles and injection supplies in an effort to reduce the risks associated with injection drug use such as contraction of HIV and Hepatitis C and other complications including skin infections, abscesses, or endocarditis.",Methadone,UC6VBE7V1Z,CCC(=O)C(CC(C)N(C)C)(C1=CC=CC=C1)C1=CC=CC=C1,NMDA receptor; Mu-type opioid receptor; Cytochrome P450 2B6; Cytochrome P450 3A4; Cytochrome P450 2C19; Delta-type opioid receptor; Cytochrome P450 3A7; Cytochrome P450 2D6; P-glycoprotein 1; Cytochrome P450 2C8; Cytochrome P450 19A1; Cytochrome P450 1A2; Cytochrome P450 2C18; Cytochrome P450 2C9; 5-hydroxytryptamine receptor 3A; Alpha-1-acid glycoprotein 1; Serum albumin; Neuronal acetylcholine receptor subunit alpha-7; Neuronal acetylcholine receptor subunit alpha-3; Neuronal acetylcholine receptor subunit alpha-4; Neuronal acetylcholine receptor subunit beta-2; Cytochrome P450 3A Subfamily; UDP-glucuronosyltransferase 2B4,Q05586; Q12879; Q13224; Q14957; O15399; Q8TCU5; O60391; P35372; P20813; P08684; P33261; P41143; P24462; P10635; P08183; P10632; P11511; P05177; P33260; P11712; P46098; P02763; P02768; P36544; P32297; P43681; P17787; P08684; Q9HB55; P20815; P24462; P06133,GRIN1; GRIN2A; GRIN2B; GRIN2C; GRIN2D; GRIN3A; GRIN3B; OPRM1; CYP2B6; CYP3A4; CYP2C19; OPRD1; CYP3A7; CYP2D6; ABCB1; CYP2C8; CYP19A1; CYP1A2; CYP2C18; CYP2C9; HTR3A; ORM1; ALB; CHRNA7; CHRNA3; CHRNA4; CHRNB2; CYP3A4; CYP3A43; CYP3A5; CYP3A7; UGT2B4,true
"A 177Lu-labeled somatostatin analog peptide, Lutetium Lu 177 dotatate belongs to an emerging form of treatments called Peptide Receptor Radionuclide Therapy (PRRT), which involves targeting tumours with molecules carrying radioactive particles that bind to specific receptors expressed by the tumour. Lutetium Lu 177 dotatate may also be referred to as 177Lu-DOTA-Tyr3-octreotate. Compared to the alternative somatostatin analogue DOTA-Tyr3-octreotide (dotatoc), Lutetium Lu 177 dotatate displays higher uptake of radioactivity in tumors and better residence times [A31696]. In terms of biodistribution, Lutetium Lu 177 dotatate demonstrated a lower whole-body retention, indicating potentially lower risk for bone marrow toxicity [A31696]. The presence of a radioligand allows monitoring of treatment response post therapy and prior to next fraction of the dose delivery which may be clinically beneficial in estimating the intensity of lesion uptakes or deciding the dose for subsequent administrations [A31702].

Lutetium Lu 177 dotatate was approved by the FDA as Lutathera in January 2018 for intravenous injection. It is a first radiopharmaceutical agent to be approved for gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (GEP-NETs) and is indicated for adult patients with somatostatin receptor-positive GEP-NETs [L1191]. Targeting pancreas and other parts of the gastrointestinal tract such as the intestines and colon, neuroendocrine tumors may commonly metastasize to metastasize to the mesentery, peritoneum, and liver [A31697]. Patients with GEP-NETs have limited second-line treatment options after the metastasis of tumors and inadequate therapeutic response from first-line therapies. In a clinical trial involving patients with advanced somatostatin receptor-positive GEP-NET, the treatment of Lutetium Lu 177 dotatate in combination with octreotide resulted in longer progression-free survival compared to patients receiving octreotide alone and there was evidence of an overall survival benefit [A31697].",Lutetium Lu 177 dotatate,AE221IM3BB,[177Lu+3].C[C@@H](O)[C@H](NC(=O)[C@@H]1CSSC[C@H](NC(=O)[C@@H](CC2=CC=CC=C2)NC(=O)CN2CCN(CC([O-])=O)CCN(CC([O-])=O)CCN(CC([O-])=O)CC2)C(=O)N[C@@H](CC2=CC=C(O)C=C2)C(=O)N[C@H](CC2=CNC3=C2C=CC=C3)C(=O)N[C@@H](CCCCN)C(=O)N[C@@H]([C@@H](C)O)C(=O)N1)C(O)=O,Somatostatin receptor type 2; Somatostatin receptor type 1; Somatostatin receptor type 3; Somatostatin receptor type 4; Somatostatin receptor type 5,P30874; P30872; P32745; P31391; P35346,SSTR2; SSTR1; SSTR3; SSTR4; SSTR5,true
"Extracted from the stem, leaves, and flowers of _Mentha piperita_ L. plant, peppermint oil (Mentha piperita) is a popular essential oil used in aromatherapy for both external and internal use. Mentha piperita is a hybrid of spearmint (Mentha spicata) and water mint (Mentha aquatica) [A33065]. Medicinal use of herbal ingredients such as peppermint oil has a long history of treating digestive disorders and upper respiratory symptoms and cough [A33055]. There are various over-the-counter and commercial uses of peppermint oil due to its carminative, cholagogue, antibacterial, secretolytic, and choleretic actions [A33056]. Peppermint oil contains pulegone, which is a naturally-occurring pesticide [F77]. Other active constituents of peppermint oil include [DB00825], menthone, cineol, and several other volatile oils [A33055, A33056]. 

Peppermint oil is used as a flavouring agent in foods and fragrance in hygienic or cosmetic products, and as an anti-itch and cooling agent in topical pharmaceutical products. It is also an active ingredient in topical analgesics for the relief of joint and muscle pain. Peppermint oil can be applied topically to temporarily relieve tension-type headache. The use of peppermint oil in the management of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) has been investigated in many clinical studies due to its relaxing effects on smooth muscle; however the evidence supporting this use is unclear. Due to its effectiveness in relaxing GI smooth muscle but ability to induce gastroesophageal reflux, enteric-coated formulations of peppermint oil has been established which bypass the upper GI tract unmetabolized, thereby facilitating its effect in the lower GI tract without effects in the upper tract [A33055]. Peppermint oil is safe and well-tolerated at commonly recommended dosage [A33055].",Peppermint oil,AV092KU4JH,,Cytochrome P450 1A2; Cytochrome P450 3A4,P05177; P08684,CYP1A2; CYP3A4,true
"Human Insulin, also known as Regular Insulin, is a short-acting form of insulin used for the treatment of hyperglycemia caused by Type 1 and Type 2 Diabetes. Human insulin is produced by recombinant DNA technology and is identical to endogenously produced insulin. Typically prescribed for the management of diabetes mellitus, insulin is a peptide hormone produced by beta cells of the pancreas that promotes glucose metabolism. Insulin is released from the pancreas following a meal to promote the uptake of glucose from the blood into internal organs and tissues such as the liver, fat cells, and skeletal muscle. Absorption of glucose into cells allows for its transformation into glycogen or fat for storage. Insulin also inhibits hepatic glucose production, enhances protein synthesis, and inhibits lipolysis and proteolysis among many other functions.

Insulin is an important treatment in the management of Type 1 Diabetes (T1D) which is caused by an autoimmune reaction that destroys the beta cells of the pancreas, resulting in the body not being able to produce or synthesize the insulin needed to manage circulating blood sugar levels. As a result, people with T1D rely primarily on exogenous forms of insulin to lower glucose levels in the blood. Insulin is also used in the treatment of Type 2 Diabetes (T2D), another form of diabetes mellitus that is a slowly progressing metabolic disorder caused by a combination of genetic and lifestyle factors that promote chronically elevated blood sugar levels. Without treatment or improvement in non-pharmacological measures such as diet and exercise to lower blood glucose, high blood sugar eventually causes cellular resistance to endogenous insulin, and in the long term, damage to pancreatic islet cells. Insulin is typically prescribed later in the course of T2D, after trying several oral medications such as [DB00331], [DB01120], or [DB01261] have been tried, when sufficient damage has been caused to pancreatic cells that the body is no longer able to produce insulin on its own. 

Marketed as the brand name product Humulin R or Novolin R, human insulin begins to exert its effects within 30 minutes of subcutaneous administration, while peak levels occur 3-4 hours after administration. Due to its quick onset of action, human insulin is considered ""bolus insulin"" as it provides high levels of insulin in a short period of time to mimic the release of endogenous insulin from the pancreas after meals. Bolus insulin is often combined with once daily, long-acting ""basal insulin"" such as [DB01307], [DB09564], and [DB00047] to provide low concentrations of background insulin that can keep blood sugar stable between meals or overnight. Use of basal and bolus insulin together is intended to mimic the pancreas' production of endogenous insulin, with a goal of avoiding any periods of hypoglycemia.

Human insulin is also available in an inhalable form, intended to be used as a bolus meal-time insulin. Exubera was the first inhaled insulin available on the market and was developed by Inhale Therapeutics (later named Nektar Therapeutics). Unfortunately, limited uptake by physicians and patients, poor sales, bulky packaging, and concerns over the possible impact on lung cancer development resulted in Exubera products being withdrawn from the US markets [A176005]. Exubera was followed by Afrezza, a monomeric inhaled insulin developed by Mannkind Corporation, which received FDA approval in 2016. While still available in the US, Afrezza has had similar concerns associated with its use, and had an FDA ""black box"" warning added to it to warn about use in patients with chronic lung disease. Afrezza does not currently have Health Canada or European Medicines Agency approval for marketing in Canada or the EU. 

Human Insulin is a 51 residue peptide hormone produced by recombinant DNA technology by inserting the human insulin gene into Escherichia coli bacteria or Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The structure is identical to native human insulin, with two amino acid chains covalently linked by disulfide bonds. 

Human insulin is also available in an intermediate-acting form as NPH (Neutral Protamine Hagedorn) as the marketed products Novolin N and Humulin N. NPH insulin is provided as a crystalline suspension of insulin with protamine and zinc, resulting in an onset of action in 1 to 3 hours, duration of action up to 24 hours, and peak action from 6 to 8 hours. Due to the added crystals, NPH insulin is typically cloudy when compared to other forms of insulin and has a neutral pH.

Without an adequate supply of insulin to promote absorption of glucose from the bloodstream, blood sugar levels can climb to dangerously high levels and can result in symptoms such as fatigue, headache, blurred vision, and increased thirst. If left untreated, the body starts to break down fat, instead of glucose, for energy which results in a build-up of ketone acids in the blood and a syndrome called ketoacidosis, which is a life-threatening medical emergency. In the long term, elevated blood sugar levels increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, and diabetic neuropathy.",Insulin human,1Y17CTI5SR,,Insulin receptor; Insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor; Insulin-degrading enzyme; Neuroendocrine convertase 2; Neuroendocrine convertase 1; Cytochrome P450 1A2; Carboxypeptidase E; Protein NOV homolog; Low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 2; Insulin-like growth factor-binding protein 7,P06213; P08069; P14735; P16519; P29120; P05177; P16870; P48745; P98164; Q16270,INSR; IGF1R; IDE; PCSK2; PCSK1; CYP1A2; CPE; NOV; LRP2; IGFBP7,true
"Cannabidiol, or CBD, is one of at least 85 active cannabinoids identified within the Cannabis plant. It is a major phytocannabinoid, accounting for up to 40% of the Cannabis plant's extract, that binds to a wide variety of physiological targets of the endocannabinoid system within the body. Although the exact medical implications are currently being investigated, CBD has shown promise as a therapeutic and pharmaceutical drug target. In particular, CBD has shown promise as an analgesic, anticonvulsant, muscle relaxant, anxiolytic, antipsychotic and has shown neuroprotective, anti-inflammatory, and antioxidant activity, among other currently investigated uses [A32477, A32469]. CBD's exact place within medical practice is still currently hotly debated, however as the body of evidence grows and legislation changes to reflect its wide-spread use, public and medical opinion have changed significantly with regards to its usefulness in a number of medical conditions ranging from anxiety to epilepsy.

From a pharmacological perspective, Cannabis' (and CBD's) diverse receptor profile explains its potential application for such a wide variety of medical conditions. Cannabis contains more than 400 different chemical compounds, of which 61 are considered cannabinoids, a class of compounds that act upon endogenous cannabinoid receptors of the body [A32584]. Cannabinoid receptors are utilized endogenously by the body through the endocannabinoid system, which includes a group of lipid proteins, enzymes, and receptors that are involved in many physiological processes. Through its modulation of neurotransmitter release, the endocannabinoid system regulates cognition, pain sensation, appetite, memory, sleep, immune function, and mood among many other bodily systems. These effects are largely mediated through two members of the G-protein coupled receptor family, cannabinoid receptors 1 and 2 (CB1 and CB2)[A32585,A32824]. CB1 receptors are found in both the central and peripheral nervous systems, with the majority of receptors localized to the hippocampus and amygdala of the brain. Physiological effects of using cannabis make sense in the context of its receptor activity as the hippocampus and amygdala are primarily involved with regulation of memory, fear, and emotion. In contrast, CB2 receptors are mainly found peripherally in immune cells, lymphoid tissue, and peripheral nerve terminals [A32676].

Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and cannabidiol (CBD) are two types of cannabinoids found naturally in the resin of the marijuana plant, both of which interact with the cannabinoid receptors that are found throughout the body. Although THC and CBD have been the most studied cannabinoids, there are many others identified to date including cannabinol (CBN), cannabigerol (CBG), [DB14050] (CBDV), and [DB11755] (THCV) that can be found within the medical cannabis [A32830]. While both CBD and THC are used for medicinal purposes, they have different receptor activity, function, and physiological effects. If not provided in their activated form (such as through synthetic forms of THC like [DB00470] or [DB00486]), THC and CBD are obtained through conversion from their precursors, tetrahydrocannabinolic acid-A (THCA-A) and cannabidiolic acid (CBDA), through decarboxylation reactions. This can be achieved through heating, smoking, vaporization, or baking of dried unfertilized female cannabis flowers.

The primary psychoactive component of Cannabis, delta 9-tetrahydrocannabinol (Δ9-THC), demonstrates its effects through weak partial agonist activity at Cannabinoid-1 (CB1R) and Cannabinoid-2 (CB2R) receptors. This activity results in the well-known effects of smoking cannabis such as increased appetite, reduced pain, and changes in emotional and cognitive processes. In contrast to THC's weak agonist activity, CBD has been shown to act as a negative allosteric modulator of the cannabinoid CB1 receptor, the most abundant G-Protein Coupled Receptor (GPCR) in the body [A32469]. Allosteric regulation is achieved through the modulation of receptor activity on a functionally distinct site from the agonist or antagonist binding site which is clinically significant as direct agonists (such as THC) are limited by their psychomimetic effects such as changes to mood, memory, and anxiety[A32469]. 

In addition to the well-known activity on CB1 and CB2 receptors, there is further evidence that CBD also activates 5-HT1A/2A/3A serotonergic and TRPV1–2 vanilloid receptors, antagonizes alpha-1 adrenergic and µ-opioid receptors, inhibits synaptosomal uptake of noradrenaline, dopamine, serotonin and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), and cellular uptake of anandamide, acts on mitochondria Ca2+ stores, blocks low-voltage-activated (T-type) Ca2+ channels, stimulates activity of the inhibitory glycine-receptor, and inhibits activity of fatty amide hydrolase (FAAH) [A31555, A31574].

CBD is currently available in Canada within a 1:1 formulation with tetrahydrocannbinol (THC) (as the formulation known as ""nabiximols"") as the brand name product Sativex. It is approved for use as adjunctive treatment for symptomatic relief of spasticity in adult patients with multiple sclerosis (MS). Sativex was also given a conditional Notice of Compliance (NOC/c) for use as adjunctive treatment for the symptomatic relief of neuropathic pain in adult patients with multiple sclerosis and as adjunctive analgesic treatment for moderate to severe pain in adult patients with advanced cancer [L886].

In April 2018, a Food and Drug Administration advisory panel unanimously recommended approval of Epidiolex (cannabidiol oral solution) for the treatment of two rare forms of epilepsy - Lennox-Gastaut syndrome and Dravet syndrome, which are among the two most difficult types of epilepsy to treat [L2721, L2719]. Epidiolex was granted Orphan Drug designation as well as Fast Track Approval from the FDA for further study in these hard to treat conditions. Notably, phase 3 clinical trials of Epidiolex have demonstrated clinically significant improvement in Lennox-Gastaut syndrome and Dravet syndrome [L2720]. On June 25th, 2018, Epidiolex was approved by the FDA to be the first CBD-based product available on the US market.",Cannabidiol,19GBJ60SN5,CCCCCC1=CC(O)=C([C@@H]2C=C(C)CC[C@H]2C(C)=C)C(O)=C1,"Cytochrome P450 2C9; Cytochrome P450 2C19; Cytochrome P450 2D6; Cytochrome P450 3A4; Cannabinoid receptor 1; Cannabinoid receptor 2; G-protein coupled receptor 12; Glycine receptor subunit alpha-1; Glycine receptor (alpha-1/beta); Glycine receptor subunit alpha-3; N-arachidonyl glycine receptor; G-protein coupled receptor 55; 5-hydroxytryptamine receptor 1A; 5-hydroxytryptamine receptor 2A; Neuronal acetylcholine receptor subunit alpha-7; Delta-type opioid receptor; Mu-type opioid receptor; Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma; Cytochrome P450 3A5; Arylalkylamine N-acetyltransferase; Cytochrome P450 1A1; Fatty-acid amide hydrolase 1; Arachidonate 5-lipoxygenase; Arachidonate 15-lipoxygenase; Quinone oxidoreductase; Multidrug resistance-associated protein 1; ATP-binding cassette sub-family G member 2; Equilibrative nucleoside transporter 1; Transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily V member 1; Voltage-dependent T-type calcium channel subunit alpha-1G; Voltage-dependent T-type calcium channel subunit alpha-1H; Voltage-dependent T-type calcium channel subunit alpha-1I; Transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily A member 1; Transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily M member 8; Transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily V member 2; Transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily V member 3; Transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily V member 4; Voltage-dependent anion-selective channel protein 1; 5-hydroxytryptamine receptor 3A; Adenosine receptor A1; Prostaglandin G/H synthase 1; Prostaglandin G/H synthase 2; Acetyl-CoA acetyltransferase, mitochondrial; Steroid 17-alpha-hydroxylase/17,20 lyase; 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase; Glutathione reductase, mitochondrial; Glutathione peroxidase 1; Indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase 1; Cytochrome P450 1B1; NAD(P)H dehydrogenase [quinone] 1; Catalase; Cytochrome P450 3A5; Cytochrome P450 2D6; Superoxide dismutase [Cu-Zn]; Cytochrome P450 1A2; Cytochrome P450 3A7; Arylalkylamine N-acetyltransferase; N-acylethanolamine-hydrolyzing acid amidase; Cytochrome P450 1A2; Cytochrome P450 1B1; Cytochrome P450 2A6; Cytochrome P450 2B6; Cytochrome P450 2C8; Cytochrome P450 2E1; Cytochrome P450 3A7; UDP-glucuronosyltransferase 1-7; UDP-glucuronosyltransferase 1-9; UDP-glucuronosyltransferase 2B7; UDP-glucuronosyltransferase 2B17; P-glycoprotein 1; Cytochrome P450 2J2; Liver carboxylesterase 1",P11712; P33261; P10635; P08684; P21554; P34972; P47775; P23415; P23415; P48167; O75311; Q14330; Q9Y2T6; P08908; P28223; P36544; P41143; P35372; P37231; P20815; F1T0I5; P04798; O00519; P09917; P16050; Q08257; P33527; Q9UNQ0; Q99808; Q8NER1; O43497; O95180; Q9P0X4; O75762; Q7Z2W7; Q9Y5S1; Q8NET8; Q9HBA0; P21796; P46098; P30542; P23219; P35354; P24752; P05093; P04035; P00390; P07203; P14902; Q16678; P15559; P04040; P00441; P05177; P24462; Q02083; P11509; P20813; P10632; P05181; Q9HAW7; O60656; P16662; O75795; P08183; P51589; P23141,CYP2C9; CYP2C19; CYP2D6; CYP3A4; CNR1; CNR2; GPR12; GLRA1; GLRA1; GLRB; GLRA3; GPR18; GPR55; HTR1A; HTR2A; CHRNA7; OPRD1; OPRM1; PPARG; CYP3A5; AANAT; CYP1A1; FAAH; ALOX5; ALOX15; CRYZ; ABCC1; ABCG2; SLC29A1; TRPV1; CACNA1G; CACNA1H; CACNA1I; TRPA1; TRPM8; TRPV2; TRPV3; TRPV4; VDAC1; HTR3A; ADORA1; PTGS1; PTGS2; ACAT1; CYP17A1; HMGCR; GSR; GPX1; IDO1; CYP1B1; NQO1; CAT; SOD1; CYP1A2; CYP3A7; NAAA; CYP2A6; CYP2B6; CYP2C8; CYP2E1; UGT1A7; UGT1A9; UGT2B7; UGT2B17; ABCB1; CYP2J2; CES1,true
